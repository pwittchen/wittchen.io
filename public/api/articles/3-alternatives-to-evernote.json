It doesn’t have dedicated desktop app, but it has Chrome extension, which behaves almost like a desktop app. It’s great for short &amp; quick text notes, simple hand drawing notes, notes with pictures &amp; even simple voice notes. It’s some kind of replacement or extension for physical yellow sticky notes. When I want to note something like one sentence or keyword quickly and I have only my phone with me, it’s perfect choice.

In addition, it easily synchronizes across all devices and allows you to export notes into single <code>*.zip</code> file. It doesn’t have folders/categories, but it has tags, which may be helpful during organizing your stuff. This is my strong personal candidate to replace Evernote.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t have mobile &amp; web apps yet. This tool is good for collecting code snippets and markdown notes, what makes it great for software developers. Moreover, you can attach any storage on your disk to this tool and fully control it. For example, you can add storage in your Dropbox account and synchronize it across devices. You can also attach it to your private Git repository and track changes in the notes. Nevertheless it requires additional work like committing &amp; pushing changes to repository.
