What I found interesting here is the fact that one of my projects called <a href=\"https://github.com/pwittchen/prefser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prefser</a> is quite popular and people really started using it in their projects! Approximately 47% of downloads of all my projects are downloads of that single library. Nevertheless, the last release of this library (v. 2.0.6) was almost one year ago. It encouraged me to put more effort into this project and make it better. I actually started working on it again and planned new releases. Trust of many people is a huge motivation factor &amp; honor for me. Do you know any more methods of measuring usage of your projects? Maybe for different technologies than Java? Share your experiences in comments :).</p>\n","more":"<p>While developing open-source projects it’s important to monitor usage of them.
