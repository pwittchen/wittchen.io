In case you don’t know, it’s a wrapper for Android SharedPreferences with object serialization and RxJava Observables. This version has the new artifact, which has codebase migrated to RxJava2.x. As usual, I kept backward compatibility with RxJava1.x.

This update was requested by at least two developers on GitHub and it’s my second most popular project, so I hope you’ll find it useful if you’re in the process of migrating from RxJava1.x to RxJava2.x.
