In Android device (mobile phone or tablet), we can go to <em>Settings</em> and then to <em>Developer options</em>. Afterwards, we can enable <em>USB Debugging</em>.

USB connection is standard way of debugging application on real devices. We can also use TCP/IP connection and debug applications wireless.

E.g. <em>adb shell</em> or <em>adb logcat</em>. If you want to list connected devices or check if any device is connected to your computer, you can use command: <em>adb devices</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>Note #1</strong>: You shouldn’t use TCP/IP and USB debugging mode at the same time. If you want to return to USB debugging mode, just connect your device to the computer via TCP/IP and then type: <em><strong>adb usb</strong></em>. After that, connect device to the computer via USB cable and you will be able to debug applications via USB connection again. </p>\n<p><strong>Note #2</strong>: In Android Studio you can use built-in terminal window instead of standard command prompt. </p>\n<p><strong>Note #3</strong>: Alternative way of returning to default debug mode (USB) is resetting the phone. You can simply turn it off and then turn it on and device will be in USB debug mode again.</p>\n","more":"<p>While developing Android applications, we need to debug them on real devices.
