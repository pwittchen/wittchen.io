If I understood them correctly, they’re planning to create non-invasive hardware &amp; software, which will be as much accurate as invasive hardware. In simple words it means, they’re not going to create implants for the brain, but some kind of wearable device, which will have the same (or better) accuracy as the brain implants, which exists today. Definitely, it’s not an easy task. If you are skeptical about such brain technologies, I can tell you that technology available today is far away from “reading the mind or thoughts”. It rather analyzes &amp; interprets brain waves and signals. It allows to determine, if we are concentrated, relaxed, sleepy, tired, etc. With more precise tools, we can simply gather more data and information, which will hopefully allow developing tools, which are capable of “typing with the brain”. Nowadays, consumer wearable electroencephalographs like <a href=\"http://neurosky.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NeuroSky</a> MindWave or <a href=\"http://choosemuse.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Muse</a> allows to read rather “binary” data like: you’re concentrated or not &amp; you’re relaxed or not. In addition, they can give you such results in percentage value. It can be used for developing simple communication apps, which can allow people to communicate with just a brain, but using them may be not so convenient, slow or inefficient. Despite these disadvantages, for people with diseases like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LIS</a>, it may be the only hope for communicating with the world. </p>\n<p>I’m keeping fingers crossed for the Facebook BCI project!
