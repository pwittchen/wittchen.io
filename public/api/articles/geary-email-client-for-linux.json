It is clean, easy to use and pretty neat e-mail client for Linux. It integrates with Unity on Ubuntu and display system notifications informing about new message.

To sum up, regardless of a few drawbacks, I can tell that Geary is really nice piece of software, which can be used on daily basis by people who like simple solutions.</p>\n","more":"<h2 id=\"Overview\"><a href=\"#Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overview\"></a>Overview</h2><p>I was using web interfaces for e-mail for a long time, but I wanted to give a try a desktop clients for Linux.
