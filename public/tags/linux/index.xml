      <description>Some time ago, I was using macOS. The thing I liked about this OS since Mojave version was the dynamic wallpaper feature. Wallpaper representing picture of the Mojave desert in California was dynamically changing during the day. In the morning, we could see the dawn and sunrise, later picture during the midday, in the evening, desert during the dusk and finally picture at night. I liked the fact that wallpaper were adjusting to the time of the day.</description>

      <description>While customizing my i3 status bar, I wanted to have currently played Spotify song in it. Some time ago, I created an open source script in Python called spotify-cli-linux and I wanted to use it. When we want to put something custom into the i3 status bar, the easiest way to do it, is to save data into the file and then read the file.
I created the following config inside ~/.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  From a long time I wanted to try lightweight WM (Window Manager) for Linux. I installed i3 once a few years ago, but I had no idea how to use it, so I just closed this thing and got back to Gnome. Recently, I watched several videos and tutorials about Linux and i3 on youtube, which helped me to learn this WM, how it works and how to use it.</description>

      <title>Fixing font rendering on Firefox and Arch Linux</title>

      <guid>https://wittchen.io/posts/fixing-font-rendering-on-firefox-and-arch-linux/</guid>
      <description>After the recent Firefox update (70.0.1 64-bit), I&amp;rsquo;ve got a problem with font rendering on Arch Linux. I&amp;rsquo;ve installed this update probably on 31.10.2019 or 01.11.2019 (I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure right now). On several pages (e.g. Facebook or Github) fonts weren&amp;rsquo;t rendered correctly. It looked like fonts without anti-aliasing what was quite ugly.
I figured out that I can go to the Firefox Settings and in the &amp;ldquo;Fonts and Colors&amp;rdquo; section, go to &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; and turn off the option &amp;ldquo;Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selection above&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I recently had an issue with Gnome on Arch Linux during the system boot. After turning my computer on, I saw gray screen with message like:
Oh no! Something has gone wrong. A problem has occurred and the system can&amp;#39;t recover... and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t log in or do anything and started searching solutions for this problem via my phone. First, I switched to terminal mode with Alt+F2(you can switch back to GUI with Alt+F1), logged in and updated system via pacman: sudo pacman -Syu.</description>

      <description>Size of the root partition / on my system is 25 GB. I recently had a situation where I received notification from the system that there&amp;rsquo;s too little free space on that partition, which was around 1 GB. My first attempt was to clean pacman cache with sudo pacman -Sc. It helped for a moment, but I kept receiving this notification. I searched for the solutions regarding extending the root partition and noticed that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that easy and probably require making backup and reinstalling the system.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we may want to format external USB drive. I recently encountered a situation, where I had bootable USB drive with operating system ready to install, but I wanted to remove all this stuff and use disk for storing data. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t format this disk with GUI tools for some reason and I kept getting errors or information that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, on Linux everything is always possible, so I quit that GUI tool, opened terminal and start playing with good old and simple programs.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  In my previous article I roughly described Arch Linux installation process. After going through whole process, we will end up with clean terminal without any graphical environment etc. In most cases, we will need it on the desktop.
Desktop Environment (DE) / Windows Manager (WM) #  There are two main types of the Linux graphical environments for desktop:
 Window Managers Desktop Environments  Window Managers are much simpler, require a lot of configuration, learning how to use them and you see all windows at once.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  For a long time, I was considering switching from Ubuntu do Arch Linux distribution, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough knowledge, time and energy to do this. I definitely knew it requires some specific knowledge and manual steps to perform. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t wat to spend too much time on reading the documentation. Moreover, I know that sometimes I could have specific issues related to my hardware, which are not listed in documentation and I have to deal with them on my own.</description>

      <description>I installed Android SDK and Android Studio on my new ThinkPad T470s with Ubuntu Linux 18.04.1 LTS. As usual, I wanted to create a new Android phone emulator called AVD (Android Virtual Device). I was able to create a new device, but unfortunately I encoutered problems. After opening AVD window, I saw the error message&amp;hellip;

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why. I&amp;rsquo;m using this service for some time and I find it really useful. Moreover, I want to backup several important files on the web server in case of my disk crashes or I&amp;rsquo;ll need to access them from another computer or mobile device.</description>

      <description>From some time, I wanted to create my own app, which will display some data in top panel in macOS or Gnome environment on Linux. I collected some resources about that and I knew that for macOS I need to write an app in Obj-C and for Gnome I need to write a plugin in JavaScript. In both cases it requires some ceremony and preparation. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve found a great app for macOS called BitBar (by the way it&amp;rsquo;s open-source).</description>

      <description>Recently, I decided to organize my Unix dotfiles in a better way. I had a few custom scripts I used in my Tmux bottom bar. I kept these scripts in .scripts directory and during installation or upgrade of my personal configuration, install.sh script was copying them from .scripts directory to /usr/local/bin/ directory. I wanted to make this configuration more solid and consistent, so I decided to transform these scripts into tmux plugins managed by tpm.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  Some time ago, I decided to learn Vim. A lot of people are afraid of this editor and they usually don&amp;rsquo;t want to know anything about it or just learn how to quit it. In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s good to learn it because after mastering the basics, we can work very efficiently. After some time of usage, we may even replace editors like Atom or Sublime Text with Vim.</description>

      <guid>https://wittchen.io/posts/tmux-auto-pane/</guid>
      <description>I just released tmux-auto-pane. It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny shell script for creating pre-defined tile layouts in Tmux on Linux with xdotool. In our workflow, we often have some pre-defined pane configurations in a terminal. The project called tmux-auto-pane helps to automate that process. It can save us some time and make us a bit more productive. We can call tmux-auto-pane with one of the following parameters:
--help | -h showing help --1l1r one left, one right --1l2r one left, two right --2l1r two left, one right --1u1d one up, one down --1u2d on up, two down --2u1d two up, one down --4tiles 4 tiles, 1 in each corner for example tmux-auto-pane --4tiles will generate such layout:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still learning Vim every day. At first, it looks quite hard and most of the people want to learn how to quit it and never use again. Nevertheless, when you learn some basics, you can be really productive. This editor has much more cool functionalities than just :q shortcut ;-). Recently I discovered, you can use Vim not only for editing files but you can use it for browsing directories as well!</description>

      <guid>https://wittchen.io/posts/control-spotify-on-linux-like-a-hacker/</guid>
      <description>Recently, I created a tiny script called spotify-cli, which allows you to control Spotify on Linux from terminal. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired by shpotify, which is a shell script doing similar things, but on macOS. My script is written in Python and uses dbus under the hood, which allows to communicate with bus daemon to pass messages between applications. I used pactl for controlling the system sound.
You can install spotify-cli as follows via wget:</description>

      <description>Introduction #  In release cycle of our team at work, we need to perform so-called system tests. In order to do that, we need to log into Artifactory, search for the latest release package, check if it&amp;rsquo;s up to date, download it, unzip it, install internal configuration recipe, compile, initialize &amp;amp; run it. Not all of that can be easily automated, but I thought that at least searching &amp;amp; downloading phase can be done from the terminal in a semi-automated way.</description>

      <description>Not all songs are available on Spotify and sometimes we need to rip music from audio CDs in order to listen it on our computer or mobile device. There are several approaches to do that. Here is mine: Get RipperX:
sudo apt-get install ripperx
Put audio CD into your computer. Open RipperX, select All Tracks and check Rip to WAV option. Set quality of output files via &amp;ldquo;Config&amp;rdquo; option and names of the tracks if your want.</description>

      <description>What is a terminal multiplexer? It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal. And do a lot more.
 - tmux.github.io
Tmux feature, which I find very useful is tiling terminal window. We can have several tiles with different terminals within a single terminal window.
How to use tiling? #  First, we need to install tmux:</description>

      <description>Overview #  Some time ago, I published post about Synapse indicator, which is an alternative to MAC&amp;rsquo;s Spotlight for Ubuntu. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found another software, which is in my opinion even better than Synapse. It&amp;rsquo;s called Mutate. I like it, because it works quite smooth, looks simple and clean. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s open-source.
Installation #  We can install it with the following commands:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mutate/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mutate Configuration #  After installation, we can run Mutate from Ubuntu dashboard or via default hot-key CTRL+D and type preference.</description>

We can disable on-line search or a few other elements, but it&amp;rsquo;s still very slow. If we want to have fast search, we can use external software like synapse.
Synapse #  Synapse is searching really fast and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait a few seconds like in Ubuntu Dash or disable some search options.</description>

Here are my favorites:

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe Ubuntu software for common users, which I personally use and which could be helpful on daily basis. Ubuntu software dedicated to programmers AKA developers will be described in separate article.
Chrome #  In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s currently the best web browser. We can download, unpack and install it, with the following commands:
sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7 wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable\_current\_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb Skype #  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not the best, but one of the most known messengers and lot of people use it.</description>

      <description>Project overview #  Some time ago, I created presentation for my university connected with Distributed Inter-Process Communication. It is a piece of software dedicated for Linux OS, created by Kamran Karimi, which allows to distribute software operations inside computer cluster. In addition, we can test it on a single machine during development process and run on a several machines in the production phase. I tested this solution on Ubuntu Linux.</description>
