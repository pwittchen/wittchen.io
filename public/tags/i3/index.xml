In the morning, we could see the dawn and sunrise, later picture during the midday, in the evening, desert during the dusk and finally picture at night. I liked the fact that wallpaper were adjusting to the time of the day.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  From a long time I wanted to try lightweight WM (Window Manager) for Linux. I installed i3 once a few years ago, but I had no idea how to use it, so I just closed this thing and got back to Gnome.
