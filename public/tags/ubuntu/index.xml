It is clean, easy to use and pretty neat e-mail client for Linux. It integrates with Unity on Ubuntu and display system notifications informing about new message.</description>

      <description>Overview #  Some time ago, I published post about Synapse indicator, which is an alternative to MAC&amp;rsquo;s Spotlight for Ubuntu. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found another software, which is in my opinion even better than Synapse. It&amp;rsquo;s called Mutate. I like it, because it works quite smooth, looks simple and clean. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s open-source.
Installation #  We can install it with the following commands:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mutate/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mutate Configuration #  After installation, we can run Mutate from Ubuntu dashboard or via default hot-key CTRL+D and type preference.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  If you were using Ubuntu for some time, you might have noticed that Ubuntu Dash from Unity is working quite slow. We can disable on-line search or a few other elements, but it&amp;rsquo;s still very slow. If we want to have fast search, we can use external software like synapse.
Synapse #  Synapse is searching really fast and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait a few seconds like in Ubuntu Dash or disable some search options.</description>

      <description>I recently found an article about Best Useful Indicators Collection for Ubuntu. Indicators are very useful feature of the Ubuntu and Unity. Ubuntu has some default indicators, but we can add new indicators if we want to. Mentioned article contains list of many indicators, but personally I prefer and use only a few of them. Here are my favorites:
Multi Load indicator #  Nice thing. This indicator monitors system resources.</description>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe Ubuntu software for common users, which I personally use and which could be helpful on daily basis. Ubuntu software dedicated to programmers AKA developers will be described in separate article.
Chrome #  In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s currently the best web browser. We can download, unpack and install it, with the following commands:
sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7 wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable\_current\_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb Skype #  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not the best, but one of the most known messengers and lot of people use it.</description>
