I also had a lot of downloaded packages in /var/cache/pacman/. As I noticed pacman -Sc command doesn’t clean all the cache and keeps the newest packages, so if we want to remove everything or almost everything, we can configure pacman appropriately or remove packages manually. These data could be cleaned and saved me a few GB of space, so I stopped seeing system notification. During cleanup, we can also have a look at other cache data, logs and /tmp/ directory. To verify disk sizes and used space, we can use df -H command.\nI hope, you’ll find this tips useful and avoid resizing root partition or system re-installation.\n","wordCount":"550","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-10-17T09:57:56Z","dateModified":"2019-10-17T09:57:56Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/cleaning-root-partition-on-linux/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
