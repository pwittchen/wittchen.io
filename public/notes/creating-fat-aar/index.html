It’s fat AAR Gradle Plugin developed by Mobbeel company.\nHere’s how I configured everything:\nIn my top-level build.gradle file I defined dependency to my custom *.jar file and other dependencies.\next.deps = [ // other dependencies goes here... thinkgear : files('library/libs/ThinkGear.jar') ] Next, I added dependency to the plugin within a buildscript section.\nbuildscript { repositories { google() jcenter() mavenCentral() maven { url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/' } } dependencies { // other plugin dependencies goes here... classpath 'gradle.plugin.com.mobbeel.plugin:mobbeel-fataar:1.2.0' } } After that, in the library/build.gradle file, I could add dependency to the *.jar file.\ndependencies { api deps.thinkgear // other dependencies goes here... } Then plugin could be applied.\napply plugin: 'com.mobbeel.plugin' And I could configure it.\nfatAARConfig { includeAllInnerDependencies false } When we set includeAllInnerDependencies parameter to true, then all transitive dependencies will be included in the fat *.aar. Default value is false and it’s OK for now. I could even skip this step, but sometimes I prefer to define things explicitly.\nNow, we can build our library.\n./gradlew build and fat *.aar will be generated in the library/builds/output/ directory as a library-release.aar file. There should be also library-debug.aar. We can unzip this file and notice that it has the following structure:\n. ├── AndroidManifest.xml ├── classes.jar └── libs ├── rxandroid.jar ├── rxjava-2.2.2.jar └── ThinkGear.jar so we can clearly see that all project dependencies are included in the *.aar file. Library deployed to the Maven Central Repository looks the same and now, users can add library as a single dependency to the project in the build.gradle file.\ndependencies { implementation 'com.github.pwittchen:neurosky-android-sdk:0.0.2' } *.jar library shipped inside *.aar file will be included in the project and everything will just work.\n","wordCount":"470","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-10-02T00:01:31Z","dateModified":"2018-10-02T00:01:31Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/creating-fat-aar/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/notes/ title=notes><span>notes</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/talks/ title=talks><span>talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/projects/ title=projects><span>projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://wittchen.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://wittchen.io/notes/>Notes</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Creating a fat AAR</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2018-10-02 00:01:31 +0000 UTC'>October 2, 2018</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;470 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Piotr Wittchen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/pwittchen/wittchen.io/blob/master/content/notes/creating-fat-aar.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I recently wrote a new library called <a href=https://github.com/pwittchen/neurosky-android-sdk>NeuroSky Android SDK</a>.
