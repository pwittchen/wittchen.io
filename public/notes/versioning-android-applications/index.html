The versionName available in Android Manifest is a string value and we can use it to store information, which we need in a current project. When we use Git as a Version Control System, we can put SHA value of a specific commit into our version name. In addition, we can add date and time of compilation to this variable. After that, our versionName contains very detailed information about current version of our application. Exemplary versionName will look in as follows: f935ea7-20140913144001.
