In my company, there&rsquo;s a concept of so-called &ldquo;innovation day&rdquo;. I have the possibility to &ldquo;use&rdquo; 1 innovation day per 2 development sprints. Last year, I used only 1 day due to the tight release schedule and a lot of work. Now, we are right after release, so I had time to take innovation day once again.

Tech stack used for this project is as follows:\nJava 8 Gradle OkHttp3 RxJava2 with Reactive Streams Gson For unit testing I used:\nJUnit Truth Mockito Quick start I wanted to make this SDK as simple as possible so the user can add YaaS integration to the Java application within just a few lines of code.\nYaaSProject project = new YaaSProject.Builder() .withClientId(\"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\") .withClientSecret(\"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\") .withOrganization(\"YOUR_ORGANIZATION\") .withService(\"YOUR_SERVICE\") .withVersion(\"v1\") .withZone(Zone.EU) .build(); Client client = new YaaS(project); client.get(\"path/to/your/endpoint\") .subscribe(response -\u003e System.out.println(response.body().string())); As you can see, it looks really simple and straightforward. In the code snippet above, we’ve done the following thigs:\nDefined YaaS Project with YaaS service Created YaaS Client Performed HTTP GET request to the endpoint of the microservice asynchronously Received and printed body of the HTTP response from the microservice on the current thread as a String All of that was done with Single type from RxJava2, which wraps Response type from OkHttp. We have a reactive stream of HTTP response here and we can do with it whatever RxJava2 offers us. Like filtering, mapping, throttling, combining it with other stream and so on. For more information, visit repository of the project at: https://github.com/pwittchen/yaas-java-sdk.\nFuture plans I have the following plans related to this project, which may be realized when I’ll have time:\nAdd more unit tests (I didn’t have enough time to cover all cases) Add continuous integration Integrate YaaS with SAP Hybris Backoffice or SAP Hybris Core Platform through this SDK (PoC) YaaS Android SDK (copy YaaS Java SDK, downgrade it to Java 7 \u0026 optionally migrate to Kotlin and create sample mobile app) Optionally, add more features to YaaS Java SDK Optionally, deploy an artifact to Maven Central repository Optionally, create SDKs for different programming languages (especially those I don’t know well or I don’t know at all - just to learn them) Links Interesting links related to this article:\nSource code of the YaaS Java SDK Basic usage of YaaS as a proxy for the microservice YaaS website SAP Hybris website ","wordCount":"482","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2017-05-28T21:24:00Z","dateModified":"2017-05-28T21:24:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/introducing-yaas-java-sdk/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
