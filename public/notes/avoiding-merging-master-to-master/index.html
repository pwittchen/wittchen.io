If you are working with Git Version Control System, probably you have seen a commit messages in your git log like:
Merge branch 'master' to 'master'
or something similar. You might have even pushed such commits! Don&rsquo;t worry, so did I ;-).
In this article I&rsquo;m going to explain why is it happenning and how to avoid it.
Such situation happens when you performed changes locally and at the same time someone else performed changes on the same branch as well, commited and pushed them to the remote repository. When you are done with your changes, you committed everything and want to push changes. If there are no conflicts, Git wants you to synchronize local repository with the remote repository. That&rsquo;s why you need to merge changes from the remote master branch into your local master branch. After that you can finally push your changes."><meta name=author content="Piotr Wittchen"><link rel=canonical href=https://wittchen.io/notes/avoiding-merging-master-to-master/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.e70ef7043b0f0268f4c98753143525282e28cccf526c6be509a7fbd3e2028037.css integrity="sha256-5w73BDsPAmj0yYdTFDUlKC4ozM9SbGvlCaf70+ICgDc=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://wittchen.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://wittchen.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://wittchen.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://wittchen.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://wittchen.io/notes/avoiding-merging-master-to-master/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://wittchen.io/notes/avoiding-merging-master-to-master/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Piotr Wittchen"><meta property="og:title" content="Avoiding merging master to master branch in Git"><meta property="og:description" content="Problem If you are working with Git Version Control System, probably you have seen a commit messages in your git log like:

That’s why you need to merge changes from the remote master branch into your local master branch.

After some period of time, you’ll get a tons of merge 'master' to 'master' messages, which doesn’t really tell you anything. It will be hard to navigate through the history of the repository and track changes. Luckily, we can avoid that.\nSolution #1 What to do, when Git wants you to merge remote master branch into local master branch? I think there may be various strategies to deal with that. I’m going to show you one approach\n1. Move your last commit into staging area git reset --soft HEAD~1 Now, you removed your last commit, but you have your changes uncommited in staging area.\n2. Move your changes from staging to unstaged area git reset HEAD -- . Now, you have your changes uncommited and unstaged.\n3. Stash your changes git stash Now, our changes are stashed. We can list them as follows:\ngit stash list To show what’s in the most recent stash, we can type:\ngit stash show -p To view an arbitrary stash, we can type something like:\ngit stash show -p stash@{1} 4. Pull changes from the remote repository git pull 5. Apply stashed changes git stash apply or\ngit stash pop if we want to delete our applied stash from the list of stashes\n6. Commit and push your changes git add -A git commit -m \"my elegant change\" git push Now, we have our local repository synchronized with the remote one. We pushed our local changes and we didn’t polluted git log with merge 'master' to 'master' commits. If you are not very comfortable with Git, try to practice this in a “test” repo before applying this approach in your production repo.\nSolution #2 I’ve got a feedback about this article from one of the readers (Thanks Cyprian! ;-) and there’s a simpler way to solve that problem.\nWe can use rebase functionality as follows:\ngit fetch origin Now we have fetched changes from the origin (remote repo) without applying (merging) them in the local repo. Next, we can rebase our changes:\ngit rebase origin/master During this operation, we have put changes from the remote repository into our local repository without merge operations. Moreover, we preserved our local (not pushed) commits. Now, we can push our changes to the remote repository:\ngit push and we’re done!\nI hope, this article will help to keep your git log clean.\nAs you see, I’m open for any kind of constructive feedback about these articles, so you can send me e-mails. Probably, I’ll add commenting functionality back to this blog, so feedback will be easier.\n","wordCount":"647","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-03-25T13:35:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-25T13:35:06Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/avoiding-merging-master-to-master/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
