In most cases, mocking part of the application’s behavior is enough. In that case, we can easily run tests on a CI server and have deterministic test results. In order to do that, we can use Robolectric.\nGradle configuration First, we have to add appropriate dependency to jacoco-android plugin in our top-level build.gradle file:\nbuildscript { repositories { jcenter() } dependencies { classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.0' classpath 'com.dicedmelon.gradle:jacoco-android:0.1.1' } } Next, we need to add appropriate test dependencies in another build.gradle file for our app or library.\ndependencies { testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12' testCompile 'com.google.truth:truth:0.32' testCompile 'org.robolectric:robolectric:3.1.2' testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:2.7.17' } I’ve added also dependencies to JUnit, Truth and Mockito library, which are used in my tests. We also need to add appropriate plugins:\napply plugin: 'jacoco' apply plugin: 'jacoco-android' To avoid ignoring our tests by the coverage report, we need to configure the following settings: android { testOptions { unitTests.all { jacoco { includeNoLocationClasses = true } } } } Next, we need to configure report output:\njacocoAndroidUnitTestReport { csv.enabled false html.enabled true xml.enabled true } Travis CI configuration We are done with Gradle configuration. I’m assuming we have Travis CI build configured. If you don’t know, how to do this, visit travis-ci.org and enable builds for your project. It’ pretty easy. Now, we should visit codecov.io website, register there (e.g. with GitHub account) and add our project. After that, we need to add the following items to our .travis.yml file:\nafter_success: - bash \u003c(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) script: - ./gradlew clean build test jacocoTestReport check Here we are performing clean, build an application, running unit tests, generating test coverage report with Jacoco and performing check (Lint, FindBugs, PMD \u0026 CheckStyle).\nWriting unit tests with Robolectric Next we can place our tests in src/test/ directory.\nSample unit test can look as follows:\n@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class) @Config(constants = BuildConfig.class) public class MyUnitTests { @Test public void myValueShouldBeTrue() { boolean myValue = true; assertThat(myValue).isTrue(); } } In my case, I also needed to create src/test/resources/robolectric.properties file with the following content:\nsdk=23 because Robolectric didn’t work with the Android SDK newer than 23. Moreover, I also needed to use Robolectric v. 3.1.2, because I had problems with running tests and generating coverage report with the latest version of the Robolectric.\nSummary When we have everything configured, we can push our tests to the GitHub repository, Travis CI build will be triggered and we can beautiful test coverage report, which can help to improve our tests.\nWe can also click on the main package and see detailed coverage information for the several packages.\nMoreover, we can analyze coverage change in time.\nI’ve applied approach described in this article in ReactiveNetwork open-source library.\nIf want to see the complete solution, take a look at the source code of this project or see its coverage report on-line.\n","wordCount":"599","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2017-03-19T19:32:00Z","dateModified":"2017-03-19T19:32:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/unit-test-coverage-report-with-travis-ci-for-robolectric-on-android/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
