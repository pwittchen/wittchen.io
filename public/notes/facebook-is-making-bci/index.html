Of course, my apps are much simpler \u0026 less advanced than the Facebook plans, but still, both of them are aiming to solve similar problems.\nFacebook is planning to hire 60 engineers and PhDs to develop new Brain-Computer Interface. If I understood them correctly, they’re planning to create non-invasive hardware \u0026 software, which will be as much accurate as invasive hardware. In simple words it means, they’re not going to create implants for the brain, but some kind of wearable device, which will have the same (or better) accuracy as the brain implants, which exists today. Definitely, it’s not an easy task. If you are skeptical about such brain technologies, I can tell you that technology available today is far away from “reading the mind or thoughts”. It rather analyzes \u0026 interprets brain waves and signals. It allows to determine, if we are concentrated, relaxed, sleepy, tired, etc. With more precise tools, we can simply gather more data and information, which will hopefully allow developing tools, which are capable of “typing with the brain”. Nowadays, consumer wearable electroencephalographs like NeuroSky MindWave or Muse allows to read rather “binary” data like: you’re concentrated or not \u0026 you’re relaxed or not. In addition, they can give you such results in percentage value. It can be used for developing simple communication apps, which can allow people to communicate with just a brain, but using them may be not so convenient, slow or inefficient. Despite these disadvantages, for people with diseases like LIS, it may be the only hope for communicating with the world.\nI’m keeping fingers crossed for the Facebook BCI project! Moreover, I’m planning to extend my own work and create more complex BCI solutions in the future. Right now, I had these ideas only in my head. I’m also not going to compete with Facebook because I don’t have knowledge or resources (at least not yet) to develop my own BCI hardware. Not to mention about 60 engineers, which are far smarter \u0026 more experienced than me. I have an idea about using hardware, which already exists on the market and to write better software for using it because a lot of solutions available now are quite poor in my opinion. It may leverage the potential of BCI in daily usage and make technologies like EEG more available \u0026 affordable for the people who need it for research or medical solutions. Having in mind the fact that Facebook is putting a lot of serious effort in BCI technology, I’m becoming more convinced that this technology may the future and the way to go.\n","wordCount":"575","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2017-04-23T22:01:00Z","dateModified":"2017-04-23T22:01:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/facebook-is-making-bci/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/notes/ title=notes><span>notes</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/talks/ title=talks><span>talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/projects/ title=projects><span>projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://wittchen.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://wittchen.io/notes/>Notes</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Facebook is making solutions to talk from the brain – so do I</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2017-04-23 22:01:00 +0000 UTC'>April 23, 2017</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;575 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Piotr Wittchen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/pwittchen/wittchen.io/blob/master/content/notes/facebook-is-making-bci.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>During <a href=https://www.fbf8.com/>F8 Facebook Developers Conference 2017</a>, Facebook revealed its plans for the nearest years.
