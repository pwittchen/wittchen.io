Nevertheless, writing an app in Kotlin requires some additional configuration and we should remember, it’s still in beta version. If you are interested in Kotlin programming for Android, take a look at Getting started with Android and Kotlin guide from official Kotlin website. You can also take a look at one of my sample apps written in Kotlin and its configuration in Gradle.\nSummary of updates ReactiveNetwork v. 0.1.3 fixed bug with incorrect status after going back from background inside the sample app reported in issue #31 fixed RxJava usage in sample app fixed RxJava usage in code snippets in README.md added static code analysis updated code formatting added sample sample app in Kotlin Unfortunately, in Android we cannot use Java 8 yet and code should be written in Java 7. We can do some hacks like using RetroLambda or libraries implementing part of functionalities available in Java 8 like streams, but these solutions are still hacks - not the right way. In Kotlin we can use lambdas like in Java 8. In addition, we have a lot of other cool features, which allow us to write less lines of code and detect possible mistakes while writing apps. E.g. Kotlin helps us to avoid NPEs with its additional operators like !!, which tells us that NPE can occur, so we can think of eliminating this possibility. If we don’t use this operator when we should, IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio will warn us. Below, we can see exemplary usage of ReactiveNetwork library with Kotlin. In this code snippet, we are using so called synthetic properties from Kotlin Extensions for Android. Value connectivity_status is an id of the view defined in XML layout. We can call it directly in Kotlin code and treat as object. It’s really useful and allows us to avoid calling findViewById(...) method for every view in Activity or injecting views with additional libraries like ButterKnife or KotterKnife. It means that we can get rid of a lot of boilerplate code.\nReactiveSensors fixed RxJava usage in sample app fixed RxJava usage in code snippets in README.md added static code analysis refactored sample app and removed repetitions in code In this project I made only changes inside the documentation, improved Gradle configuration and added another sample app. There were no changes inside the library code, so there was no need to release new library version to Maven Central Repository. Moreover, I’m going to add sample app in Kotlin for this project in the nearest future.\nReactiveBeacons v. 0.3.0 replaced distinct() operator with distinctUntilChanged() operator in Observable observe() method in ReactiveBeacons class added permissions ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to satisfy requirements of Android 6 renamed void requestBluetoothAccessIfDisabled(activity) method to void requestBluetoothAccess(activity) added boolean isBluetoothEnabled() method added boolean isLocationEnabled(context) method added void requestLocationAccess(activity) method modified sample app in order to make it work on Android 6 Marshmallow reduced target API from 23 to 22 in library due to problems with additional permissions and new permission model (it can be subject of improvements in the next releases) added package private AccessRequester class added sample app in Kotlin WeatherIconView v. 1.1.0 added icons from 2.0 version of the original weather-icons project updated compile sdk version updated Gradle Build Tools version Prefser v. 2.0.2 fixed bug reported in issue #70: get(...) method now returns a null value instead of “null” string when setting default value to null of String type fixed RxJava usage in sample app fixed RxJava usage in code snippets in README.md changed code formatting to SquareAndroid added static code analysis improved code according to static code analysis suggestions Kirai v. 1.1.0 removed formatter(...) method from Kirai class added format(...) method accepting implementation of Formatter interface to Kirai class added Syntax interface and HtmlSyntax class implementing this interface added put(String key, Object value, Syntax syntax) method to Piece class set HtmlSyntax as default Syntax implementation in Piece class removed dependencies to Android SDK updated project dependencies applied Square code style updated tests, sample app and code snippets in README.md added gh-pages with JavaDoc Any suggestions of further improvements are more than welcome as usual!\n","wordCount":"743","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2015-11-08T16:53:00Z","dateModified":"2015-11-08T16:53:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/bunch-of-updates-in-my-android-oss/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
