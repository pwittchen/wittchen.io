In both cases it requires some ceremony and preparation. Recently I&rsquo;ve found a great app for macOS called BitBar (by the way it&rsquo;s open-source). BitBar allows to put anything to macOS menu bar (top panel) in no time! With this project creating top panel apps is simplified to the limit.

We can also set refresh rate. E.g. if we want our script to be executed every 60 seconds, we can name it script.60s.sh. We can also create more advanced scripts and more details can be found in BitBar and Argos documentation. In my case, I wanted to create a script, which reads CAQI (Common Air Quality Index) in my current location based on Airly sensors. Airly provides nice API, which we can use in our projects. Please remember that most of the sensors are located in Poland.
