Moreover, we can also reactively start the server with rxListen(int port) method. This is just a basic example, where will be sending request to the only one endpoint. In the case, when we want to handle more endpoints, we can use vertx-web library and design REST API.\nfinal HttpServer server = Vertx .vertx() .createHttpServer(); server .requestStream() .toFlowable() .onBackpressureDrop() .subscribe(request -\u003e { logger.info(\"{} {}\", request.rawMethod(), request.absoluteURI()); request.response().end(\"request received\"); }); server .rxListen(8080) .subscribe(httpServer -\u003e logger.info(\"server is running at port 8080...\")); We can build this server with Gradle as follows:\n./gradlew shadowJar and then, we can run it:\njava -jar build/libs/server-fat.jar Our client will be an Android application, which will read data from the accelerometer sensor, send it to the server and display it in the TextView on a mobile device. We will use ReactiveSensors library (which was recently migrated to RxJava 2) for getting sensor readings as a Flowable data stream. Next, we will apply backpressure DROP strategy, filter only events of changing sensors (we neglect changing of the accuracy), read only one event per one second with throttleLast(int, TimeUnit) operator and map event to a String with device coordinates. Next, we are ready to send data with Completable performRequest(String), which we created earlier. Sensors readings are acquired in the computation() scheduler, send to the server with io() scheduler and passed to the UI thread on Android with AndroidSchedulers.mainThread(). Distributing operations to the different schedulers is made with subscribeOn(Scheduler) and observeOn(Scheduler).\nreactiveSensors .observeSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER) .onBackpressureDrop() .filter(ReactiveSensorFilter.filterSensorChanged()) .throttleLast(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .map(this::getSensorReading) .doOnNext(event -\u003e performRequest(event) .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) .subscribe()) .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation()) .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) .subscribe(event -\u003e tvReadings.setText(event)); It’s worth noticing that Completable performRequest(String) is using OkHttp 3 under the hood as a HTTP client, because it’s very simple example with one endpoint. In the case, we want to handle more endpoints on the client-side, it’s better to use Retrofit library. It’s also interesting that in our case, we can simulate behavior of the accelerometer and other sensors with the latest Android device emulator available in the Android SDK. It works surprisingly smooth.\nComplete working example can be found at: https://github.com/pwittchen/reactive-client-server. Later, I’ve also shown, how to use RxJava to distribute computational operations to a different threads of the CPU cores, but I’ll probably publish a separate article about that on this blog. It was the same example I shown during my JDD presentation this year.\nSlides from my part of the presentation are available below.\n{% raw %}\n{% endraw %}\nView slides on SpeakerDeck\n","wordCount":"556","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2017-11-09T22:30:00Z","dateModified":"2017-11-09T22:30:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/notes/simple-reactive-http-client-and-server-with-rxjava-vertx-and-android/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
