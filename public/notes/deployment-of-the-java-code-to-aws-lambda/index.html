In FaaS, we have just a tiny piece of code responsible for a single job, which we can take and deploy into the cloud. AWS Lambda is an example of FaaS and we’ll focus on it in this article.\nAWS Console First of all, we need to create our AWS account to have an access to AWS console. You can find the console at: https://aws.amazon.com/console/. I had a few problems regarding registration, but finally I created my account. People in support are quite helpful. Please, keep in mind the fact, that you need to provide your debit card details during the registration and they’ll charge you about 3 USD or something like that, which is a verification procedure. In AWS Lambda we’ll get 1 million of free requests per month per cloud function, which is enough for tests or even not so demanding commercial services.\nServerless Framework Serverless Framework is very convenient way of deploying Lambdas to AWS. You can install it as follows:\nnpm install serverless -g Next, you can type:\nserverless login in order to log into Serverless. We can use serverless or sls alias for this tool.\nWe also need to authorize Serverless to be able to deploy our Lambdas to AWS. We need to go to AWS Console, in the upper right corner click our name of the user and choose “My Security Credentials”. Then, we need to expand “Access Keys” and create new key and secret values. Once we got them, we can authorize Serverless:\nsls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET Serverless will store these credentials in ~./aws/credentials file. Of course, this is very simple configruation. If we need more users, groups or more sophisticated authorization mechanisms, we should apply them later via IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.\nCreating Lambda Next, we can create our AWS Lambda template. When, we type:\nsls create --template We will see the list of available templates:\nServerless: Generating boilerplate... Serverless Error --------------------------------------- Template \"true\" is not supported. Supported templates are: \"aws-nodejs\", \"aws-nodejs-typescript\", \"aws-nodejs-ecma-script\", \"aws-python\", \"aws-python3\", \"aws-groovy-gradle\", \"aws-java-maven\", \"aws-java-gradle\", \"aws-kotlin-jvm-maven\", \"aws-kotlin-jvm-gradle\", \"aws-kotlin-nodejs-gradle\", \"aws-scala-sbt\", \"aws-csharp\", \"aws-fsharp\", \"aws-go\", \"aws-go-dep\", \"azure-nodejs\", \"google-nodejs\", \"kubeless-python\", \"kubeless-nodejs\", \"openwhisk-nodejs\", \"openwhisk-php\", \"openwhisk-python\", \"openwhisk-swift\", \"spotinst-nodejs\", \"spotinst-python\", \"spotinst-ruby\", \"spotinst-java8\", \"webtasks-nodejs\", \"plugin\" and \"hello-world\". Get Support -------------------------------------------- Docs: docs.serverless.com Bugs: github.com/serverless/serverless/issues Forums: forum.serverless.com Chat: gitter.im/serverless/serverless Your Environment Information ----------------------------- OS: linux Node Version: 7.10.1 Serverless Version: 1.26.0 We will use aws-java-gradle template:\nsls create --template aws-java-gradle After that, we’ll get the following project structure:\n├── build.gradle ├── gradle │ └── wrapper │ ├── gradle-wrapper.jar │ └── gradle-wrapper.properties ├── gradlew ├── gradlew.bat ├── serverless.yml └── src └── main ├── java │ └── com │ └── serverless │ ├── ApiGatewayResponse.java │ ├── Handler.java │ └── Response.java └── resources └── log4j.properties If you want to browse source of such template, you can visit my serverless-lambda-playground repo. We can add our configurations in serverless.yml file:\nservice: aws-java-gradle provider: name: aws runtime: java8 package: artifact: build/distributions/hello.zip functions: hello: handler: com.serverless.Handler Main class is the Handler class:\npublic class Handler implements RequestHandler\u003cMap\u003cString, Object\u003e, ApiGatewayResponse\u003e { private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(Handler.class); @Override public ApiGatewayResponse handleRequest(Map\u003cString, Object\u003e input, Context context) { LOG.info(\"received: \" + input); Response responseBody = new Response(\"Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\", input); return ApiGatewayResponse.builder() .setStatusCode(200) .setObjectBody(responseBody) .setHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(\"X-Powered-By\", \"AWS Lambda \u0026 serverless\")) .build(); } } We can modify handleRequest(Map input, Context context) in order to perform any operation we want. It will be invoked after calling the Lambda. In case of JVM projects, we need to build them first:\n./gradlew build Deployment to the Cloud Next, we can deploy our Lambda to the AWS Cloud!\nsls deploy It may take more time in the beginning, but updates should be faster.\nWe should see something like that:\nServerless: Packaging service... Serverless: Creating Stack... Serverless: Checking Stack create progress... ..... Serverless: Stack create finished... Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3... Serverless: Uploading artifacts... Serverless: Validating template... Serverless: Updating Stack... Serverless: Checking Stack update progress... ............... Serverless: Stack update finished... Service Information service: aws-java-gradle stage: dev region: us-east-1 stack: aws-java-gradle-dev api keys: None endpoints: None functions: hello: aws-java-gradle-dev-hello Serverless: Publish service to Serverless Platform... Service successfully published! Your service details are available at: https://platform.serverless.com/services/pwittchen/aws-java-gradle Since that moment, our Lambda is deployed!\nBe aware of the regions! I’m beginner with AWS, so I haven’t noticed that my Lambda was deployed to us-east-1 and I was checking it on the AWS console, while being switched to another region and I didn’t know why I cannot see my function.\nNow, we can log into AWS Console and Navigate to Lambda and then to Functions. We should see our function:\nWhen, we type:\nsls info We should see information about the Lambda:\nService Information service: aws-java-gradle stage: dev region: us-east-1 stack: aws-java-gradle-dev api keys: None endpoints: None functions: hello: aws-java-gradle-dev-hello We can view details of our Lambda in AWS Console.\nExposing Lambda via API Gateway We can also apply API Gateway to expose our Lambda to the external world.\nWe can make our endpoint open or secured.\nNext, we can expand Gateway details and we should find “Invoke URL”.\nWe can call it:\ncurl https://ipj76pb5yl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/aws-java-gradle-dev-hello Of course, url will be different in your setup.\nAfter that, we should receive response:\n{ \"message\": \"Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\", \"input\": { \"resource\": \"/aws-java-gradle-dev-hello\", \"path\": \"/aws-java-gradle-dev-hello\", \"httpMethod\": \"GET\", \"headers\": { \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\", \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip, deflate, br\", \"Accept-Language\": \"en-US,en;q=0.5\", \"CloudFront-Forwarded-Proto\": \"https\", \"CloudFront-Is-Desktop-Viewer\": \"true\", \"CloudFront-Is-Mobile-Viewer\": \"false\", \"CloudFront-Is-SmartTV-Viewer\": \"false\", \"CloudFront-Is-Tablet-Viewer\": \"false\", \"CloudFront-Viewer-Country\": \"PL\", \"Host\": \"ipj76pb5yl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\", \"upgrade-insecure-requests\": \"1\", \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0\", \"Via\": \"2.0 a9e1c5fff6a2739d3f7026c216819292.cloudfront.net (CloudFront)\", \"X-Amz-Cf-Id\": \"mU9mJ_nnAMYSbqz_Iu2otYdSAG7wgW32HeVLGV388duttalquBZAHA==\", \"X-Amzn-Trace-Id\": \"Root=1-5aae6481-c429ef02c5f6dd6f25c4526a\", \"X-Forwarded-For\": \"85.14.99.231, 54.182.243.105\", \"X-Forwarded-Port\": \"443\", \"X-Forwarded-Proto\": \"https\" }, \"queryStringParameters\": null, \"pathParameters\": null, \"stageVariables\": null, \"requestContext\": { \"requestTime\": \"18/Mar/2018:13:07:13 +0000\", \"path\": \"/prod/aws-java-gradle-dev-hello\", \"accountId\": \"782268757726\", \"protocol\": \"HTTP/1.1\", \"resourceId\": \"t56p8t\", \"stage\": \"prod\", \"requestTimeEpoch\": 1521378433902, \"requestId\": \"46b8b8fb-2aad-11e8-8a1b-0b0a282c605c\", \"identity\": { \"cognitoIdentityPoolId\": null, \"accountId\": null, \"cognitoIdentityId\": null, \"caller\": null, \"sourceIp\": \"85.14.99.231\", \"accessKey\": null, \"cognitoAuthenticationType\": null, \"cognitoAuthenticationProvider\": null, \"userArn\": null, \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0\", \"user\": null }, \"resourcePath\": \"/aws-java-gradle-dev-hello\", \"httpMethod\": \"GET\", \"apiId\": \"ipj76pb5yl\" }, \"body\": null, \"isBase64Encoded\": false } } Hooray! Our Lambda is working on-line now!\nMonitoring In the “Monitoring” section of the AWS Lambda Functions Console, we can monitor usage of our service.\nUpdate If we want to update our function, we can simply modify it, rebuild code with ./gradlew build and deploy it again with sls deploy. Once we have it configured it’s really easy.\nFunction Removal If we want to remove our Function, we can just type:\nsls remove and we’ll see the following messages:\nServerless: Getting all objects in S3 bucket... Serverless: Removing objects in S3 bucket... Serverless: Removing Stack... Serverless: Checking Stack removal progress... ......... Serverless: Stack removal finished... Serverless: Successfully archived your service on the Serverless Platform Summary To wrap up, AWS Lambda is a really convenient way to solve single tasks without worrying about infrastructure, deployment and scalability. If we need one job to be done - e.g. exposing endpoint, transforming images, sending notifications, tiny app running on the server or whatever is required, AWS Lambda is good choice for that. Moreover, thanks to Serverless Framework deployment becomes really easy. In addition, we can develop Lambdas in other languages like Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, Go, Python, Node.js, C# and F#, so we’re not limited just to one language. We also should remember that AWS is powerfull platform with about 100 different services and Lambda is just one of them. It’s good to familiarize with AWS and other cloud computing platforms like Azure, GCP and so on because more companies start to invest in that and such solutions are becoming standard in certain areas.\nReferences Serverless Architecture by Martin Fowler AWS + Serverless - video tutorial AWS Console Serverless Framework Serverless Lambda Playground repository ","wordCount":"1397","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-03-18T16:50:02Z","dateModified":"2018-03-18T16:50:02Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/notes/deployment-of-the-java-code-to-aws-lambda/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script defer data-website-id=dfid_D4sN47CVgrrCRR7KCciN3 data-domain=wittchen.io src=https://datafa.st/js/script.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">

</code></pre><h2 id=summary>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary>#</a></h2><p>To wrap up, AWS Lambda is a really convenient way to solve single tasks without worrying about infrastructure, deployment and scalability. If we need one job to be done - e.g. exposing endpoint, transforming images, sending notifications, tiny app running on the server or whatever is required, AWS Lambda is good choice for that. Moreover, thanks to Serverless Framework deployment becomes really easy. In addition, we can develop Lambdas in other languages like Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, Go, Python, Node.js, C# and F#, so we&rsquo;re not limited just to one language. We also should remember that AWS is powerfull platform with about 100 different services and Lambda is just one of them. It&rsquo;s good to familiarize with AWS and other cloud computing platforms like Azure, GCP and so on because more companies start to invest in that and such solutions are becoming standard in certain areas.</p><h2 id=references>References<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#references>#</a></h2><ul><li><a href=https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html>Serverless Architecture by Martin Fowler</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71cd5XerKss">AWS + Serverless - video tutorial</a></li><li><a href=https://console.aws.amazon.com>AWS Console</a></li><li><a href=https://serverless.com/>Serverless Framework</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/pwittchen/serverless-lambda-playground>Serverless Lambda Playground repository</a></li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/tags/java/>Java</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://wittchen.io/notes/avoiding-merging-master-to-master/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Avoiding merging master to master branch in Git</span>
