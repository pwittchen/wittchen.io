    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently GitHub introduced really interesting feature to their service called <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Actions</a>. Actions can be used for automating various tasks related to the repositories like CI, CD, testing, deployment and whatnot. The general concept is as follows: We can create so called action, which can be based on a JavaScript project or a Docker container. We can also use existing actions in the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketplace</a>. Next, we can create workflow in the <code>yml</code> file, where we define our workflow. Workflow can consist of on a job with many steps using different actions. We can also define multiple jobs, where one depends on another. Workflows can be triggered in many ways. E.g. by push, pull request, creating issue, publishing release, scheduled event or external event.</p><p>E.g. we can define scheduled event, which will trigger workflow every hour as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">on:</span><br><span class="line">  schedule:</span><br><span class="line">    - cron:  &apos;0 * * * *&apos;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It has the same syntax like cron.</p><p>We can do many things with workflows and actions like deploying websites, artifacts with libraries, run tests on multiple environments, execute shell scripts on external servers and more. Have a look at the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Github documenation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketplace</a> to see what kind of actions people are creating.</p><p>I wanted to try out these actions and workflows, so I automated the deployment process of my website (this one, which you’re visiting right now). Its code is open source and you can see it at <a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/wittchen.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/pwittchen/wittchen.io</a>. I host my website on the external web server. I can access it via FTP and SSH. Website is based in <a href="http://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hexo</a> framework for static website generation. Before deployment I regenerate contents of the <code>public/</code> directory with command:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">make regenerate</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then, I can commit and push my changes to the GitHub repository. My action is triggered whenever I push a change to the <code>public/</code> directory on the repository on the <code>master</code> branch. Once it’s done, workflows checks out my repository and starts copying files the the FTP server in the defined directory. GitHub allows us to keep the secrects like usernames and passwords, tokens etc. inside the repository configuration. we can access it via repository settings on the GitHub website. Once they’re created, they cannot be viewed or edited. We can just delete them (and create again if we want to). Our workflow file has to be located in the <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory. We can have more than one workflow.</p><p>You can see my <code>deploy.yml</code> workflow below:</p><figure class="highlight yml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">Publish</span> <span class="string">Website</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">on:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  push:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    branches:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">      -</span> <span class="string">master</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    paths:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">      -</span> <span class="string">'public/*'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">jobs:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  FTP-Deploy-Action:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    name:</span> <span class="string">FTP-Deploy-Action</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    runs-on:</span> <span class="string">ubuntu-latest</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    steps:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    - uses:</span> <span class="string">actions/checkout@master</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">    - name:</span> <span class="string">FTP-Deploy-Action</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">      uses:</span> <span class="string">SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@2.0.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">      env:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">        FTP_SERVER:</span> <span class="string">$&#123;&#123;</span> <span class="string">secrets.FTP_SERVER</span> <span class="string">&#125;&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">        FTP_USERNAME:</span> <span class="string">$&#123;&#123;</span> <span class="string">secrets.FTP_USERNAME</span> <span class="string">&#125;&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">        FTP_PASSWORD:</span> <span class="string">$&#123;&#123;</span> <span class="string">secrets.FTP_PASSWORD</span> <span class="string">&#125;&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">        REMOTE_DIR:</span> <span class="string">$&#123;&#123;</span> <span class="string">secrets.FTP_REMOTE_DIR</span> <span class="string">&#125;&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">LOCAL_DIR</span> <span class="string">:</span> <span class="string">"public"</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">        ARGS:</span> <span class="bullet">--delete</span> <span class="bullet">--transfer-all</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I we can see, I defined secrects for FTP server address, username, password and remote directory.</p><p>Previously I was using <code>deploy.sh</code> bash script, which looked like that:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">source</span> .ftpconfig</span><br><span class="line">lftp ftp://<span class="variable">$USER</span>:<span class="variable">$PASS</span>@<span class="variable">$HOST</span> -e <span class="string">"set ftp:ssl-allow no;

Thanks to that, I have automated website deployment process and whenever I update my website and push the changes, it’s uploaded automatically to my server via FTP.</p><p>As we could see, GitHub actions can be hosted in the GitHub repositories, we can use them directly in our workflows and define our own custom actions in the same way.</p><p>On the <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub website</a>, we can read that depending on our subscription status, we can have several amounts of free minutes for executing actions and after crossing given thershold, we will be charged per minute in pay-as-you go model. As far I as see, amount of minutes is enough for personal usage and prices are reasonable.</p><p>If you’re using GitHub, then Actions are definitely worth considering for automation, because they give you endless opportunities for automating your work and CI/CD pipelines with huge flexibility and stability thanks to Docker containers. In the future, probably I’ll play more with it and maybe automate the last stage of the release process of my Java and Kotlin libraries with that feature.</p><h2 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/features/actions</a></li><li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions</a></li><li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow</a></li><li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/building-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/building-actions</a></li><li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/setting-up-continuous-integration-on-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/setting-up-continuous-integration-on-github</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/maddox/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/maddox/actions</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the recent Firefox update (70.0.1 64-bit), I’ve got a problem with font rendering on Arch Linux. I’ve installed this update probably on 31.10.2019 or 01.11.2019 (I’m not exactly sure right now). On several pages (e.g. Facebook or Github) fonts weren’t rendered correctly. It looked like fonts without anti-aliasing what was quite ugly.</p><p>I figured out that I can go to the Firefox Settings and in the “Fonts and Colors” section, go to “Advanced” and turn off the option “Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selection above”. It fixes problem with ugly fonts on several websites, but rest of the websites is not able to render the right fonts. E.g. when you have website with custom fonts from fonts.google.com (like this website). That’s why I couldn’t proceed with this solution.</p><p>I looked up style and font family on websites with ugly fonts  with Developer Tools and I figured out that messed up font is usually <code>Helvetica</code>. I’ve done some search and found <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ephifonts-no-helvetica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ephifonts-no-helvetica</a> package on <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUR</a>, which has the following description:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Like ephifonts, less Helvetica that messes up fonts in Firefox and Chromium.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That’s what I need!</p><p>I used my own AUR helper called <a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/aur.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aur.sh</a> (check it out by the way if you’re on Arch ;-) to install this package as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">aur get ephifonts-no-helvetica</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then I restarted Firefox and problem was finally solved.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had an issue with Gnome on Arch Linux during the system boot. After turning my computer on, I saw gray screen with message like:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Oh no! Something has gone wrong. A problem has occurred and the system can&apos;t recover...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and I couldn’t log in or do anything and started searching solutions for this problem via my phone. First, I switched to terminal mode with <kbd>Alt+F2</kbd> (you can switch back to GUI with <kbd>Alt+F1</kbd>), logged in and updated system via pacman: <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code>. I tried to install or reinstall different packages mostly related to graphic card drivers, X11 or Gnome, but it didn’t help. Luckily, I found <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=203416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this thread</a> on the Arch Forums, where there was <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1568684#p1568684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post</a> suggesting disabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_%28display_server_protocol%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayland</a> on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GDM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDM</a> by opening <code>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</code> file and uncommenting line with</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">WaylandEnable=false</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I did that. After restart, it finally fixed this problem and Gnome was loaded succesfully. That was the first time I had an issue with Boot related to Gnome and Arch. Fortunately, thanks to good community, I was able to fix it pretty quickly (in ~30 minutes) and avoided system re-installation. After that, I also had a few issues with sound on Bluetooth devices, but I fixed them quickly too.</p><p>I hope, you’ll find this post useful in case of having similar problems.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Size of the root partition <code>/</code> on my system is 25 GB. I recently had a situation where I received notification from the system that there’s too little free space on that partition, which was around 1 GB. My first attempt was to clean pacman cache with <code>sudo pacman -Sc</code>. It helped for a moment, but I kept receiving this notification. I searched for the solutions regarding extending the root partition and noticed that it wouldn’t be that easy and probably require making backup and reinstalling the system. Although installing Arch is not scary for me anymore, I didn’t want to do that again, because it takes some time and after that I will have to configure all my stuff, install apps, etc. which is a lot of work. Due to this fact I started search for the solutions about cleaning root partition. I found nice program called <code>ncdu</code>, which is abbreviation for NCurses Disk Usage according to the man page. You can install it with pacman: <code>sudo pacman -S ncdu</code>. This program shows usage of the directories and shows directories, which take the biggest amount of space on the disk. Once you have that program, you can go to the root partition and run it:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">cd</span> /</span><br><span class="line">ncdu</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It will do the analysis and return an interactive output with directories, size and visualisation of the size:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">-- / -------------------------</span><br><span class="line">. 99,8 GiB  [##########] /home</span><br><span class="line">.  12,1 GiB [#         ] /usr</span><br><span class="line">.   7,8 GiB [          ] /var</span><br><span class="line">. 689,2 MiB [          ] /opt</span><br><span class="line">. 191,4 MiB [          ] /tmp</span><br><span class="line">   55,0 MiB [          ] /boot</span><br><span class="line">.  11,3 MiB [          ] /etc</span><br><span class="line">.   1,8 MiB [          ] /run</span><br><span class="line">. 912,0 KiB [          ] /dev</span><br><span class="line">!  16,0 KiB [          ] /lost+found</span><br><span class="line">   12,0 KiB [          ] /srv</span><br><span class="line">!   4,0 KiB [          ] /root</span><br><span class="line">e   4,0 KiB [          ] /mnt</span><br><span class="line">.   0,0   B [          ] /proc</span><br><span class="line">.   0,0   B [          ] /sys</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  snap</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  sbin</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  lib64</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  lib</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  bin</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can naviagte through this directories and locate places which takes space on disk, which can be free.</p><p>For example, here are the contents of the <code>/usr/</code> directory:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">--- /usr ------------------------</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">.   5,9 GiB [##########] /share</span><br><span class="line">    5,2 GiB [########  ] /lib</span><br><span class="line">  816,9 MiB [#         ] /bin</span><br><span class="line">  279,8 MiB [          ] /include</span><br><span class="line">   15,5 MiB [          ] /local</span><br><span class="line">   13,1 MiB [          ] /src</span><br><span class="line">    5,5 MiB [          ] /lib32</span><br><span class="line">    2,5 MiB [          ] /doc</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  sbin</span><br><span class="line">@   0,0   B [          ]  lib64</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I’ve noticed that there were logs in <code>/var/log/journal/</code>, which have significant size. I also had a lot of downloaded packages in <code>/var/cache/pacman/</code>. As I noticed <code>pacman -Sc</code> command doesn’t clean all the cache and keeps the newest packages, so if we want to remove everything or almost everything, we can configure pacman appropriately or remove packages manually. These data could be cleaned and saved me a few GB of space, so I stopped seeing system notification. During cleanup, we can also have a look at other cache data, logs and <code>/tmp/</code> directory.

I recently encountered a situation, where I had bootable USB drive with operating system ready to install, but I wanted to remove all this stuff and use disk for storing data. I couldn’t format this disk with GUI tools for some reason and I kept getting errors or information that it’s not possible. In case you don’t know, on Linux everything is always possible, so I quit that GUI tool, opened terminal and start playing with good old and simple programs.</p><p>When we insert disk and type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">lsblk</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>we can see the output:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT</span><br><span class="line">loop0         7:0    0 181,1M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/spotify/36</span><br><span class="line">loop1         7:1    0 147,3M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/skype/66</span><br><span class="line">loop2         7:2    0  88,5M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/core/7270</span><br><span class="line">loop3         7:3    0   236M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/kde-frameworks-5/27</span><br><span class="line">loop4         7:4    0 180,2M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/spotify/35</span><br><span class="line">loop5         7:5    0 149,6M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/slack/16</span><br><span class="line">sdb           8:16   1   7,5G  0 disk</span><br><span class="line">└─sdb1        8:17   1   7,5G  0 part /run/media/pw/DISK3</span><br><span class="line">nvme0n1     259:0    0   477G  0 disk</span><br><span class="line">├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0   200M  0 part /boot</span><br><span class="line">├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0    24G  0 part [SWAP]</span><br><span class="line">├─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0    25G  0 part /</span><br><span class="line">└─nvme0n1p4 259:4    0 427,8G  0 part /home</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When we type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo fdisk -l</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>we’ll see:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Disk /dev/sdb: 7,51 GiB, 8053063680 bytes, 15728640 sectors</span><br><span class="line">Disk model: USB DISK</span><br><span class="line">Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes</span><br><span class="line">Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes</span><br><span class="line">I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes</span><br><span class="line">Disklabel type: dos</span><br><span class="line">Disk identifier: 0x40a863e7</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type</span><br><span class="line">/dev/sdb1        2048 15728639 15726592  7,5G 83 Linux</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we have basic information about our USB drive.

In the examples above, we’re passing a <code>report</code> or <code>data</code> variable, which usually are going to be global variables available in the scope of the whole class. These methods takes them as an argument and modify them. This idea comes from pre-OOP times and could be applied in programs written in C. Nevertheless, in Java, this technique should be avoided and is considered as a <strong>bad practice</strong>.</p><p>In Robert C. Martin’s “Clean Code” book, it’s written:</p><p><em>Output arguments should be avoided.</em></p><p>Writing code in such way can implicate many problems. Often we don’t know, by looking at the method name, how the method is going to modify the input object. Even when we’ll write unit tests for each method, the final behavior may be different because in a concrete data flow, one method can modify input object, then another method can modify the same object in a concrete order what will change the final outcome. In this approach data cannot be immutable and body of the method is tightly coupled to the class and it’s attributes, which is bad. The more methods like these, the more unpredictable and harder to test code will become. Moreover, when multiple threads will call these methods, then we can encounter errors related to concurrency or data inconsistency.</p><p><strong>How to fix this problem?</strong></p><p>First of all, we should never use input arguments. Variables used in the methods should be available only in the scode of these methods.</p><p>We can rewrite bad examples listed above in the following way:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">report.appendFooter(footer);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">final</span> Object value = createValue();</span><br><span class="line">data.setValue(value);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Source source = createSource();</span><br><span class="line">target.setValue(source);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we clearly see where objects are created, data is immutable, input parameters are not modified inside the methods, we don’t rely on the global state inside particular methods and all method’s variables are available only in the scope of the method.</p><h2 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/245809/189814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/245809/189814</a></li><li><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/322490/what-is-an-output-argument-as-refered-to-in-martins-clean-code/322495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/322490/what-is-an-output-argument-as-refered-to-in-martins-clean-code/322495</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/denizozger/clean-code#methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/denizozger/clean-code#methods</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During development of the legacy Java applications, we still have to deal with <code>null</code>. It’s possible to avoid it completly when we’re designing application from the scratch, applying proper code constructions, static code analysis and we’re consistent during code reviews. Nevertheless in majority of the cases we will encounter <code>null</code> in daily projects. We may even expect them in the method inputs and we have to be prepared for it. With the functional programming in Java we can deal with them in quite elegant way, but I often see people are not using features available nowadays.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the following code snippet:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> List&lt;MyType&gt; <span class="title">getList</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">final</span> List&lt;MyType&gt; list)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (list != <span class="keyword">null</span> || list.isEmpty()) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> Collections.emptyList();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> list</span><br><span class="line">            .stream()</span><br><span class="line">            .filter(...)</span><br><span class="line">            .collect(Collectors.toList());</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In this example <code>list</code> can be <code>null</code>, so we have to perform null-check. We can also verify if the <code>list</code> is not empty once we’re sure it’s not <code>null</code> and return empty collection in that case. If the condition is not met, we’re converting list to the stream and start processing it.</p><p>We can use <code>CollectionUtils</code> from Apache Commons library to perform exactly the same check if we have it in our project dependencies:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> List&lt;MyType&gt; <span class="title">getList</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">final</span> List&lt;MyType&gt; list)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(list)) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> Collections.emptyList();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> list</span><br><span class="line">            .stream()</span><br><span class="line">            .filter(...)</span><br><span class="line">            .collect(Collectors.toList());</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can try to figure out, how to achieve the same goal with functional programming concepts in Java and write the same logic within the single, fluent stream. We can call <code>Optional.ofNullable(...)</code> method because we know that our method argument can be <code>null</code>. Next, once we’ve got an <code>Optional</code> type, we can call <code>.orElseGet(...)</code> method and provide an object, which we want to return, when <code>nullable</code> value will be <code>null</code>. In this case, it will be an empty list. After that, we can fluently proceed with the stream processing.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> List&lt;MyType&gt; <span class="title">getList</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">final</span> List&lt;MyType&gt; list)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> Optional</span><br><span class="line">            .ofNullable(list)</span><br><span class="line">            .orElseGet(Collections::emptyList)</span><br><span class="line">            .stream()</span><br><span class="line">            .filter(...)</span><br><span class="line">            .collect(Collectors.toList());</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Code snippet above looks much more elegant, it’s shorter, more concise and we have achieved our goal within a single stream without any additional <code>if</code> statements and without breaking chain of method invocations.</p>]]></content>

This environments are also lightweight. On the other hand, we have Desktop Environments. They’re full of features, windows can be stacked one on another and you can drag and drop them. Several Desktop Environments are extensible through plugins. These kind of graphical interfaces are known to majority of computer users. You can see them on Windows or macOS. Examples of the popular Linux Desktop Environments are <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gnome</a>, <a href="https://xfce.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xfce</a> and <a href="https://kde.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE</a>. Of course, mentioned Window Managers and Desktop Environments are not the only avaiable. There are more. I just mentioned these because I’ve heard about them or tried them.</p><p>I’m using Gnome Desktop Environment right now, so I will show you how to install it in this article</p><h3 id="Installing-X-Window-System"><a href="#Installing-X-Window-System" class="headerlink" title="Installing X Window System"></a>Installing X Window System</h3><p>X Window system is a GUI component created in 80s at MIT. One of the most popular implementation of X is X.org, which we’re going to install. Gnome is built on top of X that’s why, we’re installing X first.</p><p>To install X Window system, we can type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-server-utils</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To install desktop features, we can type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S xorg-twm xorg-xclock xterm</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we can start X Window system, in which we will install Gnome</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">startx</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Installing-Gnome"><a href="#Installing-Gnome" class="headerlink" title="Installing Gnome"></a>Installing Gnome</h3><p>Let’s install required fonts:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S ttf-dejavu</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we’re ready to install Gnome:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S gnome</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Enable the display manager:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo systemctl enable gdm.service</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we can reboot our system and once computer restarts, we should see Gnome GUI</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">reboot</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Sound"><a href="#Sound" class="headerlink" title="Sound"></a>Sound</h2><p>Sound is usually not enabled by default on Arch and we need to install required software:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S alsa-utils</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>alsa-utils</code> package is recommended for this task</p><p>We can type <code>alsamixer</code> to view and adjust the configuration.</p><p>We can also test our speaker with <code>speaker-test -c 2</code> command or via Gnome GUI.</p><p>Once we’re done, it’s good to reboot the computer. </p><p>Sometimes it may be required to perform additional configuration depending on our type of computer or specific sound devices.</p><h2 id="Bluetooth"><a href="#Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Bluetooth"></a>Bluetooth</h2><p>If we’re using Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, headphones or speaker, we should install appropriate Bluetooth software:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">pacman -S pulseaudio-bluetooth</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we should enable <code>bluetooth.service</code>:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">systemctl enable bluetooth.service</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>You can connect Bluetooth Device via <code>bluetoothctl</code> or via Gnome GUI.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">bluetoothctl</span><br><span class="line">[bluetooth] power on</span><br><span class="line">[bluetooth] agent on</span><br><span class="line">[bluetooth] scan on</span><br><span class="line">[NEW] Device [MAC address]</span><br><span class="line">[bluetooth] pair [MAC address]</span><br><span class="line">[bluetooth] connect [MAC address]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Please note, that devices won’t connect automatically after turning the computer on.

Other stuff should be adjusted to our needs. We should keep in mind the fact that Arch is minimalistic distro and it shouldn’t be polluted by too many packages. We should install only what we need. Once we’re are not using a specified program, it’s good to remove it. We should read more about <code>pacman</code>, which is Arch package manager. It allows us to install packages, update and manage them. In order to update our whole operating system and its packages, we can type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -Syuw</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That’s one of the many pacman features.

While playing with aur, I was tired of repatitive tasks, so I created (yet another) simple aur helper available here: <a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/aur.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/pwittchen/aur.sh</a>, which you can use. Please note, it doesn’t resolve package dependencies yet.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Now, we have prepared simple, basic and clean desktop environment. From this point, we can proceed with the further adjustments and customizations (or leave it as it is :-). In the past I worked with Windows, macOS and Ubuntu Linux and personally I think I like Arch Linux distribution with such setup the most. I can control everything, I know what is working under the hood and how it’s configured, I have installed only software packages I really need, updates are seamless and everything just works. It’s really hard to break anything on this system if you know what you’re doing. Moreover, documentation and community are great. Of course, it requires some learning and time in the beginning, but if you’re working with computers or like playing with them, in my opinion it’s time well invested because Linux knowledge can be our great asset at work or in daily usage of the computer.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>For a long time, I was considering switching from Ubuntu do Arch Linux distribution, but I didn’t have enough knowledge, time and energy to do this. I definitely knew it requires some specific knowledge and manual steps to perform. I also didn’t wat to spend too much time on reading the documentation. Moreover, I know that sometimes I could have specific issues related to my hardware, which are not listed in documentation and I have to deal with them on my own. Due to these facts I was discouraged to install Arch. Recently, I found awesome video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PBqpX0_UOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Arch Linux Install</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Smith</a> where everything is explained very clearly in each step. I watched it one time without doing anything and then, watched it next time performing all the steps described there. I had a few issues related to my hardware and BIOS, but I managed to install Arch on my ThinkPad T470s thanks to this video. During the installation, I made a few notes for myself for the future possible installations. Maybe you’ll find them useful too. The whole process is actually simpler than I thought. It just requires some practical knowledge about Linux, patience and “can do” attitude. I divided this article into steps and sub-steps, which are required to perform the installation. Please, keep in mind the fact that in the end of the installation, we will have an empty command prompt with plain OS without any GUI and we will have to install the graphical environment from the terminal. It will not be covered in this article, but I think, I’ll cover it in another one. Of course, this article contains just my notes, which help me understand everything well because and I like documenting this kind of things for the future. If you searching for Arch installation guide, I recommend you to see linked video or an <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Arch installation guide</a> in Arch Wiki. This article can be additional resource to this stuff.</p><h2 id="Booting-installer-from-USB"><a href="#Booting-installer-from-USB" class="headerlink" title="Booting installer from USB"></a>Booting installer from USB</h2><h3 id="Creating-bootable-USB"><a href="#Creating-bootable-USB" class="headerlink" title="Creating bootable USB"></a>Creating bootable USB</h3><p>In order to create bootable USB, we need to download <code>*.iso</code> file with Arch from <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.archlinux.org/download/</a>. We also need to have <code>dd</code> (disk dump) program installed. We need to invoke <code>lsblk</code> before inserting USB drive to see our drives and invoke <code>lsblk</code> again after inserting the USB drive to see, which one it is. We can also have a look at disk sizes, what helps in recognizing our disk. Next, we can call <code>dd</code>:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">dd <span class="keyword">if</span>=/path/to/arch.iso of=/dev/sdb status=<span class="string">"progress"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>status=&quot;progress&quot;</code> parameter will allow us to monitor progress of the whole process.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: please, be sure that you are writing on the correct disk! In the example above, we’re writing to <code>/dev/sdb</code>. It may be the same in your case, but it may be different too! It’s just an example!</p><h3 id="BIOS-configuration"><a href="#BIOS-configuration" class="headerlink" title="BIOS configuration"></a>BIOS configuration</h3><p>We need to go into the BIOS before installation. It may be different on different computers. On mine it’s hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> after reboot and then <kbd>F1</kbd>. Inside BIOS, we need to change order of booting devices and move USB drive to the top. I also had to disable secure boot and quick boot. Moreover I set <code>UEFI/Legacy Boot</code> to <code>Both</code> (<code>UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority</code>: <code>UEFI First</code>, <code>CSM Support</code>: <code>YES</code>). Sometimes network boot may interrupt boot process, so I set it to <code>USB HDD</code>. I had to play more with this stuff on freshly installed system because it was not booting in the beginning. It may be different on your computer. Sometimes, there may be no issue with it.</p><h2 id="First-things"><a href="#First-things" class="headerlink" title="First things"></a>First things</h2><h3 id="UEFI-check"><a href="#UEFI-check" class="headerlink" title="UEFI check"></a>UEFI check</h3><p>Once we have booted installer from USB stick, we need to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEFI</a> check as follows.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls /sys/firmware/efivars</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>If it outputs an error or nothing, that’s ok and we can proceed with installation. If you see bunch of files, then installation procedure may be different or may require additional steps.</p><h3 id="Internet-check"><a href="#Internet-check" class="headerlink" title="Internet check"></a>Internet check</h3><p>We need to check an internet connection because we will need it to download packages. We can do it just by simple ping:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ping wittchen.io</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When we see response, that’s ok.</p><p>It’s worth to mention, that it’s good to have ethernet cable connection for the installation process. Optionally, you can use <code>wifi-menu</code> to connect wirelessly, but it’s not recommended for the installation.</p><h2 id="System-time-and-date-initial-setup"><a href="#System-time-and-date-initial-setup" class="headerlink" title="System time and date initial setup"></a>System time and date initial setup</h2><p>To perform system time and date initial setup, we need to run the following command:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">timedatectl set-ntp true</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Partitions"><a href="#Partitions" class="headerlink" title="Partitions"></a>Partitions</h2><p>Let’s see what partitions do we have on our system. We can view them with <code>lsblk</code> program.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">lsblk</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Before we start doing anything, we should remove existing partitions. We can do it with <code>fdisk</code> tool by running it with our main disk as a parameter. Usually it will be <code>/dev/sda</code>, but in my case it was <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. We can get this name from <code>lsblk</code> output.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">fdisk /dev/nvme0n1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Removing-existing-partitions"><a href="#Removing-existing-partitions" class="headerlink" title="Removing existing partitions"></a>Removing existing partitions</h3><p>Next, we can choose different options. In our case, we need to choose <code>:d</code> to delete partitions. We need to call this option for each partition.</p><p>Sometimes, we may have problems with installation or removing old partitions. In that case, we can use alternative method of cleaning disk:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sgdisk --zap-all /dev/nvme0n1p1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Creating-new-partitions"><a href="#Creating-new-partitions" class="headerlink" title="Creating new partitions"></a>Creating new partitions</h3><p>Now, we have to prepare our disk for the future system installation. Our goal is to have the following configuration of the partitions</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">nvme0n1     259:0    0   477G  0 disk</span><br><span class="line">├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0   200M  0 part /boot</span><br><span class="line">├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0    24G  0 part [SWAP]</span><br><span class="line">├─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0    25G  0 part /</span><br><span class="line">└─nvme0n1p4 259:4    0 427,8G  0 part /home</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This is the output from my current system and <code>nvme0n1</code> is the disk. First partition (<code>nvme0n1p1</code>) is <code>boot</code> partition used during the system boot. Next partition (<code>nvme0n1p2</code>) is a SWAP partition, which acts as an overflow for our RAM memory, when it gets filled up. Third partition (<code>nvme0n1p3</code>) is root partition, which is the root of the file system and programs will be installed there. The last partition (<code>nvme0n1p4</code>) is home partition, where we are going to keep our files.</p><p>In order to create new partition, we have to call <code>fdisk /dev/nvme0n1p1</code> (if we haven’t done it yet).<br>Let’s create boot partition. Type <code>:c</code> for create. We leave first sector empty, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the last sector we put <code>+200M</code> for 200 megabytes, which is recommended value for boot partitoin and confirm it with <kbd>Enter</kbd>. We follow this procedure for SWAP, which should have size = <code>1.5 * size of RAM in computer</code>. I currently have 16GB of RAM, so it’s <code>1.5 * 16 GB = 24 GB</code>, so I put <code>+24G</code> in the last sector. Next, we can create root partition. It should have around <code>+25G</code>. You can decrease it if you have small disk or increase it if you have huge disk and plans to install a lot of programs. In the end, we are creating home partition, where in the last sector option we can just hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <code>fdisk</code> will assign remaining disk space to this partition. When we’re done, we should confirm our partition configuration with <code>:w</code> like write. Then, we can type <code>lsblk</code> again to see our written configuration. It should look like in the example above.</p><h3 id="Creating-file-systems"><a href="#Creating-file-systems" class="headerlink" title="Creating file systems"></a>Creating file systems</h3><p>Next, we can to create file systems on our partitions. In general, we can use <code>ext4</code>, which is Linux file system. Some devices may have boot problems or may have specific BIOS setup. In that case, it’s recommended to use <code>FAT32</code> file system. Let’s use <code>mkfs</code> program to create file systems.</p><p>We will create <code>FAT32</code> file system on our boot partition:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then, we will create <code>ext4</code> file systems on root and home partitions:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p3</span><br><span class="line">mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p4</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Creating-SWAP"><a href="#Creating-SWAP" class="headerlink" title="Creating SWAP"></a>Creating SWAP</h3><p>Now, we can create SWAP on the <code>nvme0n1p2</code> partition:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p2</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Next, we can turn the SWAP on:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">swapon /dev/nvme0n1p2</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Mounting-partitions"><a href="#Mounting-partitions" class="headerlink" title="Mounting partitions"></a>Mounting partitions</h3><p>Right now, we are ready to mount our partitions.</p><p>We can mount the root partition as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When we list this partition:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls /mnt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>we should see <code>lost+found</code> file, which is a generic system file.</p><p>Now on the root partition we can create home and boot directories.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkdir /mnt/home</span><br><span class="line">mkdir /mnt/boot</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and mount our previously created partitions into these dirs:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot</span><br><span class="line">mount /dev/nvme0n1p4 /mnt/home</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and then we can type <code>lsblk</code> to see that everything is created properly.</p><h2 id="Arch-installation"><a href="#Arch-installation" class="headerlink" title="Arch installation"></a>Arch installation</h2><p>Now, there is an easy part.

It means, everything went fine, our system is installed and booted! Now, we’re ready to install other sutff (e.g. Desktop Environment or Window Manager). We can also leave it without GUI, if our computer has really low specs or when we’re planning to use this machine as a server or something like that.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>To wrap up, installing Arch is not trivial and requires some proficiency with Linux and terminal. Neverhteless, once you have some basics, it’s no that hard as we can expect. In addition, we have great documentation and resources on the web about it. Going through this process can be nice lesson. You can see, how much stuff automatic installers are doing for us. Moreover, we can totally adjust system to our needs. We don’t need to have a bloat of not necessary packages and programs like we have on Ubuntu. We can install exactly what we need and track our packages. I haven’t mentioned it before, but Arch has rolling release system. It means, there are no huge system updates like in Ubuntu, Windows or macOS. We can gradually update our system by installing small amount of single packages and our system can be up to date basically everyday. I’m using Arch for a few weeks for now and it seems to be one of the best and most stable operating systems I have used so far. It’s quite hard to break something on this system until you explicitly break it (e.g. by typing into terminal commands you don’t understand). It’s also light-weight and customizable. I cannot recommend this system to people who are not familiar with Linux, don’t like to play with computers and software, don’t want to fix stuff for themselves, customize system etc., but if you’re are not in this group, this OS may be for you. </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/publishing-jar-aar-to-maven-central/">previous article</a> I published information about publishing JAR/AAR library to the Maven Central Repository. A few steps of that process were automated, but a few of them were still manual. I mean closing and release process which had to be done by manual clicking on the Sonatype website. Fortunately, it’s possible to automate it. In order to do that, I used <a href="https://github.com/Codearte/gradle-nexus-staging-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gradle-nexus-staging-plugin</a> developed by <a href="https://github.com/Codearte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codearte</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>As a Java/JVM/Android developers we rely on the work of other people through frameworks and libraries. Many of them are open-source. Most of the developers are consumers of such projects. What if we would like to create our own library and distribute it to other developers? We can always create it and share a <code>*.jar</code> or <code>*.aar</code> file with others. Drawback of such solution is the fact that source of distribution may not be trusted. We also have problems with versioning. Consumers of the library have to constantly download and update their files. It’s much better to publish our library to Maven Central Repository and allow others to easily and seamlessly add it as an external dependency to <code>pom.xml</code> file (in case of Maven) or <code>build.gradle</code> file (in case of Gradle). In such case, dependency is managed by the appropriate build system and distributed via trusted source. This may be not easy for the first time that’s why I decided to collect information related to this topic in a single article. Let’s see how to do this.</p><h2 id="Generating-a-GPG-Key"><a href="#Generating-a-GPG-Key" class="headerlink" title="Generating a GPG Key"></a>Generating a GPG Key</h2><p>Before we upload library, we need to generate GPG key.</p><p>In order to generate GPG key, we need to open the terminal and type the following command:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gpg2 --gen-key</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then, we should see the output:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">gpg: key YOUR_KEY_ID marked as ultimately trusted</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Read more at: <a href="https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair</a></p><h2 id="Distributing-the-public-key"><a href="#Distributing-the-public-key" class="headerlink" title="Distributing the public key"></a>Distributing the public key</h2><p>Next, we need to distribute public key. We can do that as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys YOUR_KEY_ID</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can distribute our key to multiple servers to speed up the synchronization process (pgp.mit.edu, keyserver.ubuntu.com, etc.)</p><p>We can also list our keys as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gpg2 --list-keys</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To list secret keys, we can type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gpg2 --list-secret-keys</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Preparing-the-Gradle-configuration"><a href="#Preparing-the-Gradle-configuration" class="headerlink" title="Preparing the Gradle configuration"></a>Preparing the Gradle configuration</h2><p>In my case, I used Gradle as a build system, which works well for Java, Kotlin and Android projects. We can use Maven for this purpose as well. As a reference, I used <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/gradle-mvn-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Gradle script prepared by Chris Banes</a>.

You can have a look at <a href="https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-13199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my first issue</a>. It took a bit longer in my case, because I needed to adjust package name. </p><p>To avoid my mistakes, have a look at the following guides:</p><ul><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html</a></li><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html</a></li></ul><p>Please note, this step is required for the first time only as well as generating keys. After that, we we’ll be able to release as many artifacts under the given package name as we want. These steps need to be repeated in the case of registering the new package name.</p><p>This is reasonable from the security and stability perspective because random people cannot just override widely used packages what might cause serious problems in many projects around the world.</p><h2 id="Uploading-an-artifact"><a href="#Uploading-an-artifact" class="headerlink" title="Uploading an artifact"></a>Uploading an artifact</h2><p>Once, we have everything set up, we can go to our project via terminal, and type:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">./gradlew uploadArchives</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and wait while artifacts are being uploaded.</p><h2 id="Releasing-an-artifact"><a href="#Releasing-an-artifact" class="headerlink" title="Releasing an artifact"></a>Releasing an artifact</h2><p>Next, we need to go to the <a href="http://oss.sonatype.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://oss.sonatype.org</a> website, log in and on the left-hand side, click “Staging Repositories”. Then, we need to sort artifacts by date (Updated column), to view the recently updated items. We should find our artifact (it should be on the top) and click it. We can verify its contents to ensure that everything is ok (package name, version, etc.) and then, we should press “Release” on our artifact. Once release is done, we should press “Close” on the artifact.</p><h2 id="Commenting-the-Jira-ticket"><a href="#Commenting-the-Jira-ticket" class="headerlink" title="Commenting the Jira ticket"></a>Commenting the Jira ticket</h2><p>When we are done with the previous steps, we should go back to our Jira ticket and provide the comment:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I have promoted my first release.

Maven Sync can take no longer than 48 hours. It’s usually faster, but it won’t happen immediately after releasing and closing an artifact like in the release of the Python packages.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>We can see, that release process may be overwhelming and time consuming, but <strong>once we release the first artifact, we can skip most of these steps</strong> like generating keys and creating Jira ticket. We just need to have Gradle or Maven configuration, upload artifacts, release and close them via sonatype website and wait for the Maven Sync. Process of releasing new versions of the same artifact is the same as the first release (excluding mentioned first-time steps). During the next release, we simply need to bump library version in the Gradle configuration before uploading artifacts. In the future, I’m planning to write another article, which shows how to skip manual steps of going to Sonatype website and releasig artifacts via clicking on the page via Gradle plugins, so everything will be automated via CLI.</p><h2 id="Links-and-references"><a href="#Links-and-references" class="headerlink" title="Links and references"></a>Links and references</h2><ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28846802/how-to-manually-publish-jar-to-maven-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28846802/how-to-manually-publish-jar-to-maven-central</a></li><li><a href="https://chris.banes.dev/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://chris.banes.dev/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/</a></li><li><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/deploy-maven-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dzone.com/articles/deploy-maven-central</a></li><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html</a></li><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html</a></li><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html</a></li><li><a href="https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair</a></li><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html</a></li><li><a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html</a></li><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/diegopacheco/13c0754f0ab36482f4f804ef3f05f989" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/diegopacheco/13c0754f0ab36482f4f804ef3f05f989</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>I recently I had an opportunity to join “Kyma meets CCV2 Hackathon” in the <a href="https://www.sap.com/poland/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Labs Poland</a> office in Gliwice. The goal of the hackathon was to create a simple project, which will use <a href="https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyma</a> to integrate external services with the <a href="https://cx.sap.com/en/products/commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Hybris Commerce Platform</a>. CCV2 stands for “Commerce Cloud Version 2”, which are basically SAP Hybris Commerce solutions deployed on the MS Azure Cloud (that’s a long story described in a short way). I joined a team consisting of people from a few different departments in the office, so we didn’t actually know each other before the event. We decided to create a simple application consisting of a few microservices, which will send an e-mail with a promotional link to the user once he or she add something to the cart in the on-line shop. After clicking on the link sent via the e-mail, user will be redirected to the front-end application, where he or she has to click on the button as many times as possible in a given period of time.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/2018/kyma-meets-ccv2-hackathon-summary/clickr_frontend.png" alt=""></p><p>The more clicks were performed, the higher discount user will get, but not higher than 20%. When game is finished, front-end application is sending a request to the voucher service from which we can retrieve a promotional code. </p><p><img src="/images/posts/2018/kyma-meets-ccv2-hackathon-summary/clickr_frontend2.png" alt=""></p><p>With this code, we can go to the SAP Hybris Commerce store-front…</p><p><img src="/images/posts/2018/kyma-meets-ccv2-hackathon-summary/storefront1.png" alt=""></p><p>…and get our discount!</p><p><img src="/images/posts/2018/kyma-meets-ccv2-hackathon-summary/storefront2.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="Application-overview"><a href="#Application-overview" class="headerlink" title="Application overview"></a>Application overview</h2><p>General concept of the application flow is presented on the diagram below.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/2018/kyma-meets-ccv2-hackathon-summary/diagram.png" alt=""></p><p>We decided to create three microservices:</p><ul><li>mailing service written in Node.js</li><li>front-end application with clicking game written in JavaScript</li><li>voucher service written in Kotlin</li></ul><p>All microservices needed to have corresponsing Docker containers, which were deployed to the Kyma instance. Kyma was communicating with SAP Hybris Commerce platform written in Java. Thanks to clear separation of a different environments, we were able to integrate services using different technologies.</p><h2 id="Creating-a-microservice"><a href="#Creating-a-microservice" class="headerlink" title="Creating a microservice"></a>Creating a microservice</h2><p>I was responsible for writing voucher storage microservice. On daily basis I use Java programming language, but I wanted to try something new, so I chose Kotlin. Kotlin is a JVM language, so it runs on the same runtime as regular Java applications. Moreover, I could use tools I’m familiar with like IntelliJ, Gradle, etc. In my microservice I used <a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gradle</a> as a build tool, <a href="http://javalin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javalin</a> for designing REST API and <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dagger</a> for Dependency Injection. Moreover, for writing unit tests I used <a href="https://junit.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JUnit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Pragmatists/JUnitParams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JUnitParams</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/truth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mockito</a>. I also wrote a few integration tests for the API with <a href="https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST Assured</a>. As you can see, I could easily use Java libraries in the Kotlin application because those two languages are fully interoperable.</p><p>REST API definition of my application looks pretty simple:</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Application</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">companion</span> <span class="keyword">object</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Application::<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span>.<span class="title">java</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> component = DaggerApplicationComponent.create()</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> voucherController = component.voucherController()</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> voucherHttpFacade = component.voucherHttpFacade()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="meta">@JvmStatic</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">fun</span> <span class="title">main</span><span class="params">(args: <span class="type">Array</span>&lt;<span class="type">String</span>&gt;)</span></span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      Javalin</span><br><span class="line">          .create()</span><br><span class="line">          .enableCorsForAllOrigins()</span><br><span class="line">          .requestLogger &#123; ctx, time -&gt;</span><br><span class="line">            logger.info(<span class="string">"<span class="subst">$&#123;ctx.method()&#125;</span> <span class="subst">$&#123;ctx.path()&#125;</span> <span class="subst">$&#123;ctx.status()&#125;</span> took <span class="variable">$time</span> ms"</span>)</span><br><span class="line">          &#125;.routes &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">"/voucher"</span>) &#123; voucherHttpFacade.getAll(it) &#125;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">"/voucher/:group"</span>) &#123; voucherHttpFacade.getGroup(it) &#125;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">"/health"</span>) &#123; it.json(Health(<span class="string">"UP"</span>)).status(HttpStatus.OK_200) &#125;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">"/"</span>) &#123; it.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN_403) &#125;</span><br><span class="line">          &#125;</span><br><span class="line">          .event(JavalinEvent.SERVER_STARTING) &#123; voucherController.loadVouchers() &#125;</span><br><span class="line">          .start(<span class="number">7000</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I have an endpoint for gathering all vouchers, gathering single voucher for a given group and deactivating it and health-check.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I had an opportunity to speak at the software development conference abroad for the first time. I visited Malmö in Sweden and gave a talk during the <a href="http://oredev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Øredev</a> 2018 conference. The main theme of the conference was Deus Ex Machina, so I decided to adapt to this topic and prepared presentation about Brain-Computer Interfaces, which is my interest since the end of my studies at the Silesian University of Technology where I wrote a Master Thesis about similar topic. Before the conference, I prepared the same presentation in Polish during the SAP Lunch Talks for the colleagues from my company in Gliwice, Poland.</p><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="0d3626bc99734bf1b7d6468960bbb523" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><h2 id="Interactions-with-the-audience"><a href="#Interactions-with-the-audience" class="headerlink" title="Interactions with the audience"></a>Interactions with the audience</h2><p>After my presentation people sent tweets on the web and even made really nice notes!</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/roshan_khan/status/1064559411199467520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/roshan_khan/status/1064559411199467520</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/katrina_tester/status/1064560075786866688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/katrina_tester/status/1064560075786866688</a></li></ul><p>I was impressed by that!</p><p>Except for interactions on the web, I got a few interesting questions from the audience during the Q&amp;A session and after the presentation. Moreover, people were willing to talk about the subject of the presentation during the conference what was really nice and shown their interest in this area. If you didn’t have an opportunity to see this presentation, but you are interested in watching it, it should be available on YouTube on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0XtR2kcXnqtfrGSsxM8oAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Øredev Channel</a> and I’ll add appropriate link on the <a href="http://wittchen.io/talks/">talks</a> page on this website once I get it.</p><h2 id="Experiences-from-the-conference"><a href="#Experiences-from-the-conference" class="headerlink" title="Experiences from the conference"></a>Experiences from the conference</h2><p>Attending such international event as a speaker was really interesting experience, which broadens my mind. I met nice and interesting people from different countries all over the world. There was also some time to <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinMost7/status/1064158140143419394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab local craft beers and talk with other speakers</a>. Organization and logistics of the conference were really good. Conference organizers covered costs of the flights, accommodation and organised everything in advance. Moreover, there were additional activities for speakers like sauna, dinner and meeting in the city hall of Malmö. There was also a party and performance in the end of the second day for all attendees. Breaks between the sessions were fine (around 20-30 minutes), so people didn’t have to rush from one room to another. There were 7 concurrent sessions on 2 floors. Technicians in the rooms also did great job and everything worked without any problems. It’s worth mentioning that food was quite good and healthy what is not usual thing during IT conferences. I also attended talks of other speakers and I can tell that there was wide variety of topics: programming, AR, VR, mathematics, JVM, new programming languages (e.g. Unison), UX, Mobile, Music, Security, Machine Learning, AI, Biohacking, Art, etc. Presenters were well prepered and most of the presentations I attended were interesting and entertaining. There were also discussion panels where audience could ask questions. This form of sharing knowledge and opinions was good addition to regular talks. To sum up, I had to put some effort and spend some time during my preparations and sending call for papers, but in general it was good decision to join this event. I can recommend it to everyone interested in IT.</p><h2 id="References-and-links"><a href="#References-and-links" class="headerlink" title="References and links"></a>References and links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/neurosky-android-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/pwittchen/neurosky-android-sdk</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/EEGReader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/pwittchen/EEGReader</a></li><li><a href="http://wittchen.io/tags/bci/">http://wittchen.io/tags/bci/</a></li><li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pwittchen/brain-computer-interfaces-science-fiction-or-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://speakerdeck.com/pwittchen/brain-computer-interfaces-science-fiction-or-reality</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pwittchen.eeganalyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pwittchen.eeganalyzer</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.choosemuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://developer.choosemuse.com/</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.neurosky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://developer.neurosky.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface</a></li><li><a href="http://oredev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://oredev.org/</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <title>Creating a fat AAR</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote a new library called <a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/neurosky-android-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeuroSky Android SDK</a>. It’s used for writing Android apps using signals of the brain waves received from the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile headsets. Probably I’ll write a separate article about it because it’s quite interesting topic. This library uses ThinkGear library, which is distributed by the NeuroSky as a <code>*.jar</code> file, so I couldn’t use it as a Gradle or Maven dependency in my project and I had to put this <code>*.jar</code> file into the <code>lib</code> directory and link it in the <code>build.gradle</code> file. Moreover, I wanted to create a library, which can be added to the project as a single Gradle dependency without messing around with additional <code>*.jar</code> files or custom configuration. Due to this fact, I decided to create a fat <code>*.aar</code> file and deploy it to the Maven Central repository. For those who are not familar with Android, <code>*.aar</code> is an Android version or <code>*.jar</code> file, which can be used as library in the project. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, so I searched for the different solutions. Unfortunatey, a few of them didn’t work, but luckilly I’ve found what I wanted. It’s <a href="https://github.com/Mobbeel/fataar-gradle-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fat AAR Gradle Plugin</a> developed by <a href="https://github.com/Mobbeel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobbeel</a> company.</p><p>Here’s how I configured everything:</p><p>In my top-level <code>build.gradle</code> file I defined dependency to my custom <code>*.jar</code> file and other dependencies.</p><figure class="highlight gradle"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ext.deps = [ <span class="comment">// other dependencies goes here...</span></span><br><span class="line">             thinkgear : files(<span class="string">'library/libs/ThinkGear.jar'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">           ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Next, I added dependency to the plugin within a <code>buildscript</code> section.</p><figure class="highlight gradle"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">buildscript</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">repositories</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    google()</span><br><span class="line">    jcenter()</span><br><span class="line">    mavenCentral()</span><br><span class="line">    maven &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      url <span class="string">'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">dependencies</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">   <span class="comment">// other plugin dependencies goes here...</span></span><br><span class="line">   <span class="keyword">classpath</span> <span class="string">'gradle.plugin.com.mobbeel.plugin:mobbeel-fataar:1.2.0'</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>After that, in the <code>library/build.gradle</code> file, I could add dependency to the <code>*.jar</code> file.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">dependencies &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  api deps.thinkgear</span><br><span class="line">  // other dependencies goes here...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then plugin could be applied.</p><figure class="highlight gradle"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">apply plugin: <span class="string">'com.mobbeel.plugin'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And I could configure it.</p><figure class="highlight gradle"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">fatAARConfig &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  includeAllInnerDependencies <span class="keyword">false</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When we set <code>includeAllInnerDependencies</code> parameter to <code>true</code>, then all transitive dependencies will be included in the fat <code>*.aar</code>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During development process, we often write unit and integration tests. While unit tests verify corectness of the small pieces of code, integration tests verify software as a whole project and sometimes can treat it as a black box where concrete results are expected. During development of the REST API, we can write integration tests for such API with <a href="https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST Assured</a>. Integration tests are usually slower, because they need to start the server and sometimes do other stuff. That’s why it’s good to separate their execution from regular unit tests. On the CI server we can even have separate job for them.</p><p>We can define the following project structure:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">+ src</span><br><span class="line">|</span><br><span class="line">+- main</span><br><span class="line">|  |</span><br><span class="line">|  +- java</span><br><span class="line">|    |</span><br><span class="line">|    +- com ...</span><br><span class="line">|</span><br><span class="line">+- test</span><br><span class="line">  |</span><br><span class="line">  +- java</span><br><span class="line">    |</span><br><span class="line">    +- com ...

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Java, we can test exceptions via unit tests in a few different ways. In this article, I’ll present common methods of doing that. Nevertheless, I suppose we there are different methods as well.</p><p>First method is basically wrapping a method call with try-catch block, assigning an exception to a variable and performing appropriate assertion. In these examples, I’m using <a href="https://junit.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JUnit</a> for unit tests and <a href="https://google.github.io/truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth</a> for assertions.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Test</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">shouldTestExceptionWithTryCatch</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  Exception caughtException = <span class="keyword">null</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">try</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> RuntimeExcetpion(<span class="string">"message"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125; <span class="keyword">catch</span> (<span class="keyword">final</span> Exception e) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    caughtException = e;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  assertThat(caughtException).hasMessageThat().isEqualTo(<span class="string">"message"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In the second method, we can define a type of the thrown exception within the <code>@Test</code> annotation. It’s useful approach when we don’t want to test exception details like message and we care only about the type.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Test</span>(expected = RuntimeException.class)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">shouldTestExceptionWithExpectedAnnotation</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="keyword">throws</span> RuntimeException </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> RuntimeException(<span class="string">"message"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can also test exceptions with AssertJ library as follows:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Test</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">shouldTestExceptionWithAssertJ</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="keyword">throws</span> RuntimeException </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  Throwable thrown = catchThrowable(<span class="keyword">this</span>::throwException);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  org.assertj.core.api.Assertions</span><br><span class="line">      .assertThat(thrown)</span><br><span class="line">      .isInstanceOf(RuntimeException.class)</span><br><span class="line">      .hasMessage(EXCEPTION_MESSAGE);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Another method allows us to test exception type, message and other details without wrapping method call with try-catch block, what increases code readibility and makes it clear. In order to achieve that, we need <code>@Rule</code> annotation and <code>ExpectedException</code> object like in the code snippet below. What is important in this example, we have to define assertions in the beginning and invoke method, which will throw an exception after these assertions. It’s different order than in a regular unit test.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Rule</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> ExpectedException expectedException = ExpectedException.none();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Test</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">shouldTestExceptionWithRuleAnnotation</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="keyword">throws</span> RuntimeException </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  expectedException.expect(RuntimeException.class);</span><br><span class="line">  expectedException.expectMessage(EXCEPTION_MESSAGE);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> RuntimeException(<span class="string">"message"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Alternatively, we can experiment with <a href="https://www.vavr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vavr</a> and <code>Try</code> interface.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Test</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">shouldTestExceptionWithTryCatchAndVavr</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">final</span> Object object = </span><br><span class="line">    Try</span><br><span class="line">      .of(<span class="keyword">this</span>::throwException)</span><br><span class="line">      .toOption()</span><br><span class="line">      .getOrElse(<span class="keyword">new</span> ErrorObject());</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  assertThat(object).isInstanceOf(ErrorObject.class);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> Object <span class="title">throwException</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> RuntimeException(<span class="string">"message"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ErrorObject</span> </span>&#123;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We can even go crazy and prepare RxJava wrapper for our exception.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> Completable <span class="title">toCompletable</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">final</span> Runnable runnable)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> Completable.create(emitter -&gt;

Don’t treat that as a production-ready code (unless there’s a reson you really need something like that).</p><p>I think, we can find even more ways of testing exceptions. In my opinion, solution with JUnit and <code>@Rule</code> annotation is the cleanest and most flexible one among all of the approaches presented here. It’s good to mention that last two approaches are just experiments. I also recommend Truth for writing assertions. Nevertheless, libraries like FEST, AssertJ and others, which have fluent interfaces helping in error analysis are also worth considering in daily usage.</p><p>Do you know other (maybe better) approaches of testing exceptions in Java? Share them in comments :-).</p>]]></content>

I created a few Java and Android libraries already and this time I decided to use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlin</a> programming language instead of Java to learn something new and write something more complicated than “Hello World” app. Here are my observations.</p><h2 id="Build-System"><a href="#Build-System" class="headerlink" title="Build System"></a>Build System</h2><p>I used <a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gradle</a> to build the project. It’s popular for JVM and Android apps nowadays and works fine with Kotlin. I just needed to add Kotlin Gradle Plugin and Kotlin STD Lib to the <code>/library/build.gradle</code> file to the <code>classpath</code> dependencies in <code>buildscript</code> section. I also needed to define <code>sourceSets</code> to allow IntelliJ and Android Studio recognize directories with sources.</p><figure class="highlight groovy"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

Google promotes this language during Google I/O events and recommends to use it for Android development. Moreover, it’s regular JVM language, so we can use it anywhere we want - on Android (mobile), on servers and even on desktop apps. I haven’t discovered all the features of this language during writing this tiny project, but I have a few observations. Writing code is a bit strange because I got used to programming in Java. In Kotlin, we define the function or variable name first, then we put colon and we define the type next. It’s opposite to Java, where types are defined first. </p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">fun</span> <span class="title">createBroadcastReceiver</span><span class="params">(emitter: <span class="type">FlowableEmitter</span>&lt;<span class="type">BatteryState</span>&gt;)</span></span>: BroadcastReceiver &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">val</span> status: <span class="built_in">Int</span> = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_STATUS, UNKNOWN)</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Moreover, there’s type inference in Kotlin and sometimes compiler is able to guess our type, so we don’t have to provide it. See the following example:</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">val</span> emitter = mock(FlowableEmitter::<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span>.<span class="title">java</span>)</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In addition, we don’t have to put semicolon in the end of the statement as you can see on the code snippets above, what is really convenient. The thing, I really like about Kotlin is <strong>null safety</strong></p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (intent != <span class="literal">null</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">val</span> status: <span class="built_in">Int</span> = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_STATUS, UNKNOWN)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>If we don’t do that, code won’t compile. We can avoid such null-checks, by using <code>!!.</code> operator like here:</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">val</span> status: <span class="built_in">Int</span> = intent!!.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_STATUS, UNKNOWN)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>but by looking at the code, we can see that there are two exclamation marks, so clearly something must be wrong here and we should think about improvement. Moreover, when NPE occurs, it’ll be easier to find.</p><p>Kotlin is also <strong>more concise</strong> than Java. It’s hard to say if it’s an advantage or drawback. In Java we have more code, but we clearly know what’s going on when the code is clean. In Kotlin a lot of stuff is <strong>implicit</strong>.</p><p>E.g. inheritance looks as follows:</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">MainActivity</span> : <span class="type">AppCompatActivity</span></span>()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and sometimes we don’t have variable provided in the lambda, when there’s only one value and we can invoke this value by calling <code>it</code> object</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">batteryDisposable = RxBattery</span><br><span class="line">  .observe(<span class="keyword">this</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())</span><br><span class="line">  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())</span><br><span class="line">  .subscribe &#123; textView.text = it.toString() &#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The thing I like about implicit Kotlin code is <strong>data classes</strong>.

In Java, we would need to write it by hand, use code generators in the IDE or code generation libraries like Lombok.</p><p>When we take a look at the <strong>control flow</strong> in Kotlin, except for <code>if</code> expression, <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, we also have <code>when</code> expression, which can be kind of neat equivalent to <code>switch</code> instruction in Java. It looks like this:</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">fun</span> <span class="title">plugged</span><span class="params">()</span></span>: Plugged &#123;</span><br><span class="line">   <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">when</span> (pluggedCode) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">     BatteryManager.BATTERY_PLUGGED_AC -&gt; Plugged.AC</span><br><span class="line">     BatteryManager.BATTERY_PLUGGED_USB -&gt; Plugged.USB</span><br><span class="line">     BatteryManager.BATTERY_PLUGGED_WIRELESS -&gt; Plugged.WIRELESS</span><br><span class="line">     <span class="keyword">else</span> -&gt; Plugged.UNKNOWN</span><br><span class="line">   &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It’s worth to say that there’s good <strong>inter-operability</strong> between Java and Kotlin. We can use Kotlin modules and libraries in Java projects and vice-versa because everything compiles to the same byte-code. We can even create pure Java code in the Kotlin module. For example, I wanted to have static method called from the Kotlin library. In order to achieve that, I needed to wrap whole class in a Companion Object.</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">RxBattery</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">companion</span> <span class="keyword">object</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    ...</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Next, in the Kotlin module, I could call it like this:</p><figure class="highlight kotlin"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">RxBattery.observe(<span class="keyword">this</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>but in Java module it wasn’t possible and I needed to write something like this:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">RxBattery.Companion.observe(context);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I didn’t want library users to call this <code>Companion</code> value explicitely in Java projects, so I created additional Java class.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">RxBatteryFactory</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="title">RxBatteryFactory</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> Flowable&lt;BatteryState&gt; <span class="title">observe</span><span class="params">(Context context)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> RxBattery.Companion.observe(context);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>and put it next to the Kotlin classes.

Next, I could just call <code>./gradlew uploadArchives</code>, close and release library on the OSS SonaType website.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>To wrap up, Kotlin is an interesting language. It’s hard to say, if it’s really better than Java although it has a few interesting features. Nevertheless, it’s good to familiarize with it because it’s being promoted by Google and JetBrains. JetBrains company actually created and develops this language, so due to this fact, I’m able to put more trust in that project. If you would like to see complete code and configuration of the project mentioned in this article, check out my <a href="https://github.com/pwittchen/RxBattery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RxBattery</a> repository on GitHub.

I couldn’t understand why. I’m using this service for some time and I find it really useful. Moreover, I want to backup several important files on the web server in case of my disk crashes or I’ll need to access them from another computer or mobile device. I googled this issue and found pretty long thread on the <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Syncing-and-uploads/Dropbox-client-warns-me-that-it-ll-stop-syncing-in-Nov-why/td-p/290058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox Forum</a>.

I think it’s nice opportunity to learn something new and solve my own problem at the same time. I have my own personal FTP server where I host my website. This server has about 4 GB of disk space. I’m not using all of this space because my website has only text and maybe a few small pics. I also store my photos on the local drive, Google Photos and external physical drive and I’m not going to backup them on the FTP server. I’d like to backup a several dirs with documents, config files, text files and spreadsheets. In such case, mentioned amount of disk space is enough.</p><p>In the beginning, I’ve created a special directory for backup in my local file system: <code>~/Backup/</code>.<br>Next, I’ve created <code>backup/</code> directory on the FTP server.</p><p>After that, I’ve prepared <code>make_ftp_backup</code> script:</p><h3 id="Backup-script"><a href="#Backup-script" class="headerlink" title="Backup script"></a>Backup script</h3><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"starting backup process"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">rm -rf ~/Backup/*</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"preparing directories to backup"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">cp -avr ~/Dokumenty/finance ~/Backup/finance</span><br><span class="line">cp -avr ~/Dokumenty/gym ~/Backup/gym</span><br><span class="line">cp -avr ~/Dokumenty/licenses ~/Backup/licenses</span><br><span class="line">cp -avr ~/Dokumenty/secret ~/Backup/secret</span><br><span class="line">cp -avr ~/Dokumenty/sonatype ~/Backup/sonatype</span><br><span class="line">cp -avr ~/Dokumenty/presentations ~/Backup/presentations</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"uploading data to the FTP server"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">USER=your-user</span><br><span class="line">PASS=your-password</span><br><span class="line">HOST=your-host.com</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">lftp ftp://<span class="variable">$USER</span>:<span class="variable">$PASS</span>@<span class="variable">$HOST</span> -e <span class="string">"set ftp:ssl-allow no; mirror -R -v --delete-first ~/Backup backup; quit"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">date &gt;&gt; ~/Dokumenty/logs/ftp_backup.log</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"backup process finished"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Once I had my script ready, I made it executable: <code>chmod +x make_ftp_backup</code><br>and placed it in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> directory.</p><p>Now, I could test it by typing the following command in the terminal: <code>make_ftp_backup</code>.</p><p>Script is pretty simple.

Sometimes we may want to add some data from another computer or mobile device and access them later on the local computer. We shouldn’t place this data to the <code>backup</code> directory because it may be overriden by the backup script. To solve this problem, we can create <code>input</code> directory on the remote server and <code>input</code> directory in the local file system. After that, we can create <code>get_ftp_input</code> script, which will copy remote directory to local file system.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">USER=your-user</span><br><span class="line">PASS=your-password</span><br><span class="line">HOST=your-host.com</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"downloading input from the server"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">lftp ftp://<span class="variable">$USER</span>:<span class="variable">$PASS</span>@<span class="variable">$HOST</span> -e <span class="string">"set ftp:ssl-allow no; mirror -v input ~/Dokumenty/input; quit"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">date &gt;&gt; ~/Dokumenty/logs/ftp_input.log</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"download complete"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It’s not real synchronization like in the Dropbox, but at least we have simple way add new files to the local computer from the different device with Internet access and FTP client.

It’s really good app and it has FTP client built-in, so I can access my backup folder from my mobile phone if I need to.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>I know this solution is far from perfect (I call it poor myself) and it doesn’t handle two way synchronization, but at least I have full control over it and nobody tells me what file system or operating system I have to use or what I need to leave encrypted or unencrypted. It’s clean, simple and fine for me now. Maybe I’ll enhance this solution some day. E.g. I can add a new script performing backup whenever I change any file in defined list of directories. In order to do that, I’ll need a file watcher running as a system service in the background. The biggest room is the room for improvement.</p>]]></content>
