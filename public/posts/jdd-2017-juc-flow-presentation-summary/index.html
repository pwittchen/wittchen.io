There were even people sitting on the floor due to lack of free chairs what really surprised me. In the Eventory app, more than 85 people joined the lecture, but in reality, there could be about 100 people or more. It was really flattering that such huge and great audience decided to listen to my talk. In fact, that was the biggest audience I have ever had during the public presentation so far. Moreover, people were asking many interesting questions during Q\u0026A session and after the presentation, so it means they were interested in this topic and they wanted to learn more, understand it and apply it in their projects. If you haven’t had the opportunity to see this presentation, but you would like to, JDD organizers will provide video recordings from the sessions. In addition, you can monitor Talks page on this blog, where I publish my past and upcoming sessions. Probably, I’ll present this topic again during one or two meetups because people are interested in it. Joining JDD 2017 as a speaker was a great experience. It cost me an additional work and effort after hours, but at the end of the day, it was totally worth it and it was much easier to establish contacts and meet new people as a speaker than as an attendee, what is important for me. Moreover, I could learn new things from other people as well because general level of the conference presentations was pretty high. Thanks for the interesting questions, discussions, other good presentations and support before the talk!
