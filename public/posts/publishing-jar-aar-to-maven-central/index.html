As a Java/JVM/Android developers we rely on the work of other people through frameworks and libraries. Many of them are open-source. Most of the developers are consumers of such projects.

This may be not easy for the first time that’s why I decided to collect information related to this topic in a single article. Let’s see how to do this.\nGenerating a GPG Key Before we upload library, we need to generate GPG key.\nIn order to generate GPG key, we need to open the terminal and type the following command:\ngpg2 --gen-key Then, we should see the output:\n... gpg: key YOUR_KEY_ID marked as ultimately trusted ... Read more at: https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair\nDistributing the public key Next, we need to distribute public key. We can do that as follows:\ngpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys YOUR_KEY_ID We can distribute our key to multiple servers to speed up the synchronization process (pgp.mit.edu, keyserver.ubuntu.com, etc.)\nWe can also list our keys as follows:\ngpg2 --list-keys To list secret keys, we can type:\ngpg2 --list-secret-keys Preparing the Gradle configuration In my case, I used Gradle as a build system, which works well for Java, Kotlin and Android projects. We can use Maven for this purpose as well. As a reference, I used a Gradle script prepared by Chris Banes. You can have a look at it in one of my projects.\nIn my libraries, I usually have the following structure:\n/ ├── library │ ├── gradle.properties │ └── build.gradle │ ├── build.gradle ├── maven_push.gradle └── gradle.properties In maven_push.gradle I keep the mentioned release script. In the library/gradle.properties, I keep details about artifact released from a given directory:\nPOM_NAME=reactivenetwork POM_ARTIFACT_ID=reactivenetwork-rx2 POM_PACKAGING=aar It can be jar if you’re releasing pure Java library. Here’s an example for Android library.\nIn the /gradle.properties file, I keep release configuration:\nVERSION_NAME=3.0.3 VERSION_CODE=34 GROUP=com.github.pwittchen POM_DESCRIPTION=Android library listening network connection state and Internet connectivity with RxJava Observables POM_URL=https://github.com/pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork POM_SCM_URL=https://github.com/pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork POM_SCM_CONNECTION=scm:git@github.com:pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork.git POM_SCM_DEV_CONNECTION=scm:git@github.com:pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork.git POM_LICENCE_NAME=The Apache Software License, Version 2.0 POM_LICENCE_URL=http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt POM_LICENCE_DIST=repo POM_DEVELOPER_ID=pwittchen POM_DEVELOPER_NAME=Piotr Wittchen org.gradle.daemon=true org.gradle.jvmargs=-XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Xmx2048m In the library/build.gradle file I need to include release Gradle script:\napply from: '../maven_push.gradle' ... In the $HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties file, I keep system-wide release configuration for Sonatype:\nsigning.keyId=YOUR_KEY_ID signing.password=YOUR_SIGNING_PASSWORD signing.secretKeyRingFile=/home/piotr/.gnupg/secring.gpg NEXUS_USERNAME=YOUR_NEXUS_USERNAME NEXUS_PASSWORD=YOUR_NEXUS_PASSWORD YOUR_NEXUS_USERNAME and YOUR_NEXUS_PASSWORD can be defined during account creation on the http://oss.sonatype.org website.\nOf course, you need to provide your own path to secretKeyRingFile, which was created during generating key.\nIf you’re interested in the complete project structure prepared for library release, you can have a look at the following examples:\nJava library (compiled into *.jar file): https://github.com/pwittchen/kirai Android library written in Java (compiled into *.aar file): https://github.com/pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork Android library written in Kotlin (compiled into *.aar file): https://github.com/pwittchen/RxBiometric Creating a Jira ticket for Sonatype We should create a Sonatype Jira account and a new project ticket. You can have a look at my first issue. It took a bit longer in my case, because I needed to adjust package name.\nTo avoid my mistakes, have a look at the following guides:\nhttps://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html Please note, this step is required for the first time only as well as generating keys. After that, we we’ll be able to release as many artifacts under the given package name as we want. These steps need to be repeated in the case of registering the new package name.\nThis is reasonable from the security and stability perspective because random people cannot just override widely used packages what might cause serious problems in many projects around the world.\nUploading an artifact Once, we have everything set up, we can go to our project via terminal, and type:\n./gradlew uploadArchives and wait while artifacts are being uploaded.\nReleasing an artifact Next, we need to go to the http://oss.sonatype.org website, log in and on the left-hand side, click “Staging Repositories”. Then, we need to sort artifacts by date (Updated column), to view the recently updated items. We should find our artifact (it should be on the top) and click it. We can verify its contents to ensure that everything is ok (package name, version, etc.) and then, we should press “Release” on our artifact. Once release is done, we should press “Close” on the artifact.\nCommenting the Jira ticket When we are done with the previous steps, we should go back to our Jira ticket and provide the comment:\nI have promoted my first release. Thanks. Waiting for the Maven sync After all of these steps, we need to wait for the acceptance from the people from Sonatype and Maven Sync. Maven Sync can take no longer than 48 hours. It’s usually faster, but it won’t happen immediately after releasing and closing an artifact like in the release of the Python packages.\nSummary We can see, that release process may be overwhelming and time consuming, but once we release the first artifact, we can skip most of these steps like generating keys and creating Jira ticket. We just need to have Gradle or Maven configuration, upload artifacts, release and close them via sonatype website and wait for the Maven Sync. Process of releasing new versions of the same artifact is the same as the first release (excluding mentioned first-time steps). During the next release, we simply need to bump library version in the Gradle configuration before uploading artifacts. In the future, I’m planning to write another article, which shows how to skip manual steps of going to Sonatype website and releasig artifacts via clicking on the page via Gradle plugins, so everything will be automated via CLI.\nLinks and references https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28846802/how-to-manually-publish-jar-to-maven-central https://chris.banes.dev/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/ https://dzone.com/articles/deploy-maven-central https://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html https://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html https://gist.github.com/diegopacheco/13c0754f0ab36482f4f804ef3f05f989 ","wordCount":"1045","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-05-24T19:18:27Z","dateModified":"2019-05-24T19:18:27Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/publishing-jar-aar-to-maven-central/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)">Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/talks/ title=talks><span>talks</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Publishing a JAR/AAR to the Maven Central</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2019-05-24 19:18:27 +0000 UTC'>May 24, 2019</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1045 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Piotr Wittchen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/pwittchen/wittchen.io/blob/master/content/posts/publishing-jar-aar-to-maven-central.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>As a Java/JVM/Android developers we rely on the work of other people through frameworks and libraries.

During the next release, we simply need to bump library version in the Gradle configuration before uploading artifacts. In the future, I&rsquo;m planning to write another article, which shows how to skip manual steps of going to Sonatype website and releasig artifacts via clicking on the page via Gradle plugins, so everything will be automated via CLI.</p><h2 id=links-and-references>Links and references<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#links-and-references>#</a></h2><ul><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28846802/how-to-manually-publish-jar-to-maven-central>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28846802/how-to-manually-publish-jar-to-maven-central</a></li><li><a href=https://chris.banes.dev/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/>https://chris.banes.dev/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/</a></li><li><a href=https://dzone.com/articles/deploy-maven-central>https://dzone.com/articles/deploy-maven-central</a></li><li><a href=https://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html>https://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html</a></li><li><a href=https://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html>https://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html</a></li><li><a href=https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html>https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html</a></li><li><a href=https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair>https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair</a></li><li><a href=https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html>https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html</a></li><li><a href=https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html>https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html</a></li><li><a href=https://gist.github.com/diegopacheco/13c0754f0ab36482f4f804ef3f05f989>https://gist.github.com/diegopacheco/13c0754f0ab36482f4f804ef3f05f989</a></li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/java/>Java</a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/gradle/>Gradle</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/posts/zen-of-java-library-release-process/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Zen of the Java library release process</span>
