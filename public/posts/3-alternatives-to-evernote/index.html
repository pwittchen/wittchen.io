The main drawback is lack of the Linux desktop app. I’m using this app on Android phone, Macbook (at work) and on Linux (at home). There are community apps like NixNote2, which is nice, but in my opinion it’s not good enough. Moreover, Evernote seems to have too many features, which distract me and I don’t really use most of them. A few of these features may be really helpful for some use cases, but not for mine. I need simpler \u0026 cleaner tool for taking basic personal notes, which is available on all operating systems. I’ve started searching for Evernote alternatives. Below you can find my types worth checking.\nGoogle Keep It’s nice \u0026 quite popular tool from Google with Android app. I started using it before Evernote. It doesn’t have dedicated desktop app, but it has Chrome extension, which behaves almost like a desktop app. It’s great for short \u0026 quick text notes, simple hand drawing notes, notes with pictures \u0026 even simple voice notes. It’s some kind of replacement or extension for physical yellow sticky notes. When I want to note something like one sentence or keyword quickly and I have only my phone with me, it’s perfect choice. Nevertheless, it’s not so good for a longer notes. Link: https://keep.google.com\nSimplenote This app is nice, clean \u0026 elegant. Moreover, it has desktop apps for all popular destkop \u0026 mobile operating systems: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android \u0026 iOS. It has less features than Evernote, but it’s sufficient for me. In addition, it easily synchronizes across all devices and allows you to export notes into single *.zip file. It doesn’t have folders/categories, but it has tags, which may be helpful during organizing your stuff. This is my strong personal candidate to replace Evernote. This app is developed by Automattic, a company behind Wordpress \u0026 other nice tools. Link: https://simplenote.com\nBoostnote Boostnote is another interesting tool worth checking out. It’s open-source and works on Linux, Windows \u0026 macOS. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have mobile \u0026 web apps yet. This tool is good for collecting code snippets and markdown notes, what makes it great for software developers. Moreover, you can attach any storage on your disk to this tool and fully control it. For example, you can add storage in your Dropbox account and synchronize it across devices. You can also attach it to your private Git repository and track changes in the notes. Nevertheless it requires additional work like committing \u0026 pushing changes to repository. This tool is under development. Maybe it wouldn’t be perfect replacement for Evernote, but it definitely looks promising. Link: https://boostnote.io\nSummary As we can see there are many tools for taking notes. Sometimes, I also use regular physical notepad, sticky notes \u0026 pen, which are perfect when power goes down or you want to have a break from the machines. We don’t have to be sticked to one tool forever.\n","wordCount":"505","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2017-04-23T17:47:00Z","dateModified":"2017-04-23T17:47:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Piotr Wittchen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wittchen.io/posts/3-alternatives-to-evernote/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Piotr Wittchen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wittchen.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wittchen.io/ accesskey=h title="Piotr Wittchen (Alt + H)"><img src=https://wittchen.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Piotr Wittchen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/talks/ title=talks><span>talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/pwittchen title=code><span>code</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/setup/ title=setup><span>setup</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wittchen.io/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://wittchen.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://wittchen.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>3 Alternatives to Evernote</h1><div class=post-meta><span title="2017-04-23 17:47:00 +0000 UTC">April 23, 2017</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;505 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Piotr Wittchen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/pwittchen/wittchen.io/blob/master/content/posts/3-alternatives-to-evernote.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=https://evernote.com>Evernote</a> for some time for taking longer notes, but it started to annoy me a little bit.
