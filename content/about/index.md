Hello! I’m **Piotr Wittchen**, and I’m glad you took the time to visit my personal website.

I’m the [**Software Engineer**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pwittchen/) from Poland with a strong background in Java. I’ve worked in a variety of environments, including **software houses, large corporations, and startups**, which has given me broad perspective on building and maintaining software at different scales. Over the years, I’ve worked on mobile Android applications, backend systems, data-streaming applications, and software libraries.

I also have experience with Swift and iOS, Kotlin, Python, and I’ve recently started exploring Rust.

I enjoy learning new programming languages and technologies to broaden my horizons and to be able to choose the best tool for a given task. I used to give [talks](/talks) at the conferences and meetups and share my knowledge on the [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1150795/piotr-wittchen). From time to time, I contribute to [**open-source software**](https://github.com/pwittchen) and build my own [**personal projects**](/projects).

## Setup

You can check the tools and setup I use daily on the [setup](/setup) page.
