Currently, I work on my Final Project and **Master Thesis** at Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland (original University name in Polish: Politechnika Śląska). I've decided to choose unconventional topic, which will allow me to use the knowlegde I already have, extend it and learn something new. Topic of my thesis is: _**Brain Computer Interface for mobile devices**_. [BCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) is a topic, which is not completely discovered nowadays. [EEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) and BCI have their origins in 1924, but up to now, they don't have so many real life applications. We can find only some experiments and simple games. Recently, companies, engineers and scientists started to focus on brain waves, so this topic is worth investigation and it may be the future of modern computing. In my project, I am going to use BCI for controlling mobile devices with Android OS. In my opinion, connecting brain to the smartphone can have really interesting outcome. Below, you can browse my presentation, which I have shown on my Final Project Seminar today.
