Some time ago I participated in first Google Glass Hackathon in Poland, where I had possibility to test Google Glass, try it and write applications, which can be run on this cutting-edge device. It was very interesting experience. In addition, I took 2nd place with my team, what made me happy after leaving Warsaw late night. In a few hours, we created simple native application for Android platform, which can be used as a city guide with augmented reality, geolocation and image recognition. We called it _Hereandhounds_. You can see its source code at: [https://github.com/pwittchen/Hereandhounds](https://github.com/pwittchen/Hereandhounds). You can read detailed report from that event at technical blog of Future Processing: [http://www.future-processing.pl/blog/relacja-z-pierwszego-w-polsce-glass-hackathonu/](http://www.future-processing.pl/blog/relacja-z-pierwszego-w-polsce-glass-hackathonu/ "http://www.future-processing.pl/blog/relacja-z-pierwszego-w-polsce-glass-hackathonu/"). Unfortunately, its available **only in Polish language** right now.
