Recently, during [Meet & Code](http://media30.pl/2017/10/06/meet-and-code-spotkajmy-sie-w-gliwicach/) event organized by [Media 3.0](http://media30.pl/) and [SAP Hybris](https://www.hybris.com/en/), I've gave a talk for university and high-school students about basics of Git. Presentation was titled [Git - tips & tricks](https://speakerdeck.com/pwittchen/git-tips-and-tricks) and was organized at the Silesian Univeristy of Technology in the AEI Department where I was studying a few years ago. Presentation covered quite essential usage of Git, which could be helpful for people who are planning to learn it from the scratch. Nevertheless, in the talk I included a few tips, which could be applied even by more advanced users in their daily work. You can view slides from this presentation below.
