Today I had talk at [Future Processing](http://www.future-processing.com/) about Android. It was part of company's Java show & tell series. I wanted to make it interesting both for people without any experience with Android development and for people who already know something about this platform. Presentation was divided into three main parts:

*   **Basics**
*   **Challenges**
*   **Techniques**

Below, you can browse slides from the presentation.

Of course, slides does not show everything I prepared, but they are good summary of the talk. I hope you find it interesting and useful. Feel free to give me any feedback about the presentation (especially if you attended it in person. ;-)) !
