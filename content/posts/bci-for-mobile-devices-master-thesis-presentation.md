Recently, I graduated from [my university](http://www.polsl.pl/). Below, you can browse my Master Thesis presentation about _Brain-Computer Interface for mobile devices_. If you are interested in writing mobile Android applications communicating with NeuroSky MindWave Mobile device, you can check my [EEG Reader](https://github.com/pwittchen/EEGReader/) project on GitHub, which can be treated as a basis for more advanced projects. During writing my Master Thesis, I created two another projects using similar concepts. Mentioned code may be a little bit outdated comparing to the newest Android trends, but feel free to fork and upgrade it.

**Update**: You can read a publication based on my Master Thesis in the _Journal Of Medical Informatics & Technologies Vol. 24/2015, ISSN 1642-6037_ : [**Brain-Computer Interface for Mobile Devices**](http://jmit.us.edu.pl/cms/jmitjrn/24/15_Dobosz.pdf)
