Hi!
---

My name is **Piotr Wittchen**. I am **software developer** from Gliwice, Poland and working at [SAP Hybris](https://hybris.com). I graduated Engineering and Master studies of Automatic Control, Electronics and Computer Science at Silesian University of Technology. I’m also member of [Silesia JUG (Java Users Group)](http://silesia.jug.pl). I&nbsp;have a few years of experience of working as a software developer. I worked mostly with web and mobile applications in different domains and technology stacks starting from tiny startup-like apps to enterprise software. I’m not limiting myself to any technology or programming language. I try to learn and apply the best software engineering practices in daily work and become better programmer and person every day. I’ve&nbsp;created this blog in order to collect and share my thoughts, experiences, links, code, notes and learn new stuff. I hope, someone else will learn something new here as well. I like to use open-source projects and [contributing back](https://github.com/pwittchen) to the community. If you are interested in my selected private work, you can view it in the [Projects](/projects) section. From time to time, I give [talks](/talks) related to IT at the conferences and meetups. Besides geeky stuff, I like fresh drip coffee brew, different kinds of sports, traveling, music and playing the guitar.
