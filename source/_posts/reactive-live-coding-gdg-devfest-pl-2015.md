I was asked to be a speaker during [GDG DevFest](http://devfest.pl) 2015 conference in Warsaw, Poland. Of course, I accepted this invitation and prepared presentation titled "Reactive Live Coding". Presentation covered basics of Reactive Programming, RxJava and RxAndroid. Besides my talk I've done live coding to show how to use mentioned libraries and basics principles of Reactive Programming in real life. I had only 20 minutes for all of that, so my time-box was very limited. Being a speaker at conference was really interesting and challenging experience, which I haven't had before. Moreover, I could meet a lot of interesting people and hear very inspiring talks covering different topics.
