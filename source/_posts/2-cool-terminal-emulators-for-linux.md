There are many terminal emulators for Linux, but two of them acquired my attention.

[Yakuake](https://www.kde.org/applications/system/yakuake/)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yakuake is a terminal emulator, which you can drop down from the top of the screen in any situation. It may look familiar to those who played Quake III, because this game has a very similar concept of the terminal for configuration purposes. It's very convenient when we want to check something quickly. We can just press `F12` do our task and press the same key to close the window.

[Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/)
--------------------------------------------

Tilix is another interesting terminal emulator, which is quite similar to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for macOS. It has the possibility to create tiles and tabs just like iTerm2. It can be some kind of alternative for Tmux. Moreover, it allows searching through the console what is very useful. Do you know more interesting terminal emulators for Linux or maybe for other operating systems? Share them in comments!
