Today I released [Weather Icon View](https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView) library v. [1.0.0](https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView/releases/tag/v1.0.0) It's very simple and easy to use Android library, which allows you to use [Weather Icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons/) created by [Erik Flowers](https://github.com/erikflowers) in your mobile applications. This library was already available on GitHub as I wrote in [one of my previous posts](http://blog.wittchen.biz.pl/weather-icons-for-android-applications/), but today it was released to Maven Central Repository and you can use it as [Maven or Gradle dependency](https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView#download). I was encouraged to make this project more available by the open-source community and people who find it useful as I could read in the [issue](https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView/issues/1) reported on the repository website. Thanks for that. You can find more details, usage examples and sample app in the repository of the project at: [https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView](https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView).
