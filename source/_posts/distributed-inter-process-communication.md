Project overview
----------------

Some time ago, I created presentation for my university connected with [Distributed Inter-Process Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Inter-Process_Communication). It is a piece of software dedicated for Linux OS, created by [Kamran Karimi](http://dipc.kamran-karimi.com/), which allows to distribute software operations inside computer cluster. In addition, we can test it on a single machine during development process and run on a several machines in the production phase. I tested this solution on Ubuntu Linux. Short description of this system is presented below.

> DIPC (Distributd Inter-Process Communication) is a software-only solution for distributed data exchange on a network on Linux computers. It operates at the kernel level, and allows the programmer to use System V semaphores, message queues, and shared memory segments over the network with minimal change at the source code level.
