Recently, [Square](http://squareup.com) engineers confirmed my doubts I always had about fragments. I definitely knew that something was wrong with them, but Google introduced fragments into Android API, so I thought it must be okay for some reason and I tried to live with them feeling pain. Finally, concrete company have written an article criticizing Android Fragments and I totally agree with them.
