## Introduction

I took part in a serveral interview processes and I decided to wrap up all of my experiences because it may be helpful for people preparing for the interview for a software developer or software engineer role. After reading this article, you should have rough idea about what to expect. Please note, I was interviewed mostly for companies in Poland, but I also started a few processes for the companies abroad. I was talking with big and small companies, corporations and startups. Most of my interviews were related to Java/JVM Backend Developer role, but I also took part in interviews for Full-Stack Java Developer role or Android Developer (Java/Kotlin) roles. I didn't passed all interview processes. I passed part of them and at the same time I failed part of them. It's worth keeping in mind the fact that when you failed a process, it doesn't mean you are not good enough for the role. Company may have limited budget, limited job positions, other candidates (who are better or cheaper depending on the company requirements), you couldn't fit into company interview process, you may be rejected be mistake (there's no perfect process), process may be broken (e.g. someone forgot to complete it due to the mess in the company) and so on. If you are rejected, **always as for the feedback**, so you will know what you need to improve in the future, what you need to learn or how to change your mindset or attitude. It can be very valuable information.

## Technical talk

It's quite popular form of the interview. Usually, you have a series of questions regarding your experience and technical background. You also may expect questions regarding basics of your programming language, its internals and sometimes more advanced stuff like concurrency or framework, which you have been using. Moreover, you can have questions related to clean code, testing, version control systems, good software development practices, design patterns and sometimes databases. It's good to be familiar with the stuff mentioned in the job description. If you don't have experience with a given framework, library, language and so on, just say it, so you won't be asked about that. Nobody knows everything and lying is not a good idea. You also should be prepared for a questions like: "What's the most interesting project you had?" or "What was your biggest technical challenge at work?" etc. It's good to have one story or two prepared ahead, so you don't have to figure this out during the conversation.
