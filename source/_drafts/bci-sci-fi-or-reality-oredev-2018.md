Recently, I had an opportunity to speak at the software development conference abroad for the first time. I visited Malmö in Sweden and gave a talk during the [Øredev](http://oredev.org/) 2018 conference. The main theme of the conference was Deus Ex Machina, so I decided to adapt to this topic and prepared presentation about Brain-Computer Interfaces, which is my interest since the end of my studies at the Silesian University of Technology where I wrote a Master Thesis about similar topic. Before the conference, I prepared the same presentation in Polish during the SAP Lunch Talks for the colleagues from my company in Gliwice, Poland.

## Interactions with the audience

After my presentation people sent tweets on the web and even made really nice notes!

Except for interactions on the web, I got some questions from the audience during the Q&A session and after the presentation. Moreover, people were willing to talk about the subject of the presentation during the conference what was really nice and shown their interest in this area. If you didn't have an opportunity to see this presentation, but you are interested in watching it, it should be available on YouTube and I'll add appropriate link on the [talks](http://wittchen.io/talks/) page on this website once I get it.

## Wrapping up

Attending such international event as a speaker was really interesting experience, which broadens my mind. I met nice and interesting people from different countries all over the world - e.g. Germany, New Zeland, USA, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, UK, Italy, Australia, but also Poland. Conference was dominated by Scandinavian people due to its location, but it was truly international. Organization and logistics of the conference were really good. Moreover, there were additional activities for speakers like sauna, dinner and meeting in the city hall of Malmö. Breaks between the sessions were fine (around 20-30 minutes), so people didn't have to rush from one room to another. There were 7 concurrent sessions on 2 floors. Technicians in the rooms also did great job and everyhitng worked without any problems. It's worth mentioning that food was quite good and healthy what is not usual thing during the IT conferences. To sum up, it was good decision to join this event.
