tags:

TBD.

shortly:

- change on remote repo
- change on local repo
- commit and push
- merge master to master

...

- move last commit to stage
- move stage to unstage
- stash changes
- pull
- stash apply
- commit and push

TODO:

describe process above nicely (maybe add some charts? they could be even in ascii)
