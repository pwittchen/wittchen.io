## Introduction

From a long time I wanted to try lightweight WM (Window Manager) for Linux. I installed i3 once a few years ago, but I had no idea how to use it, so I just closed this thing and got back to Gnome. Recently, I watched several videos and tutorials about Linux and i3 on youtube, which helped me to learn this WM, how it works and how to use it. I also read some part of [docs](https://i3wm.org/docs/) and [user's guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) to customize my configuration. Official docs of i3 are really good.

## Concept

The original concept of i3 and tiling windows managers in general is the fact, that windows are not layered one on top of another like in all typical GUIs for popular operating systems we know today. It makes sense, because when one window is behind another, you cannot see its content anyway. It's possible to do that in i3 by detaching a windows and moving them around, but it's not usual case and default behavior. Today we can see that operating systems like Windows or macOS are trying to mimic behavior of tiling window managers with window splitting, etc. This functionality is available in Unity for Ubuntu and can be achieved with additional plugins for Gnome environment. We also have applications like iTerm for macOS or Tilix for Linux, which mimics the same thing, but just for terminals. In i3, we have this functioality out of the box for *all* programs we use in the system. Not just terminals. We can also use the same key bindings and shortcuts across whole system, which is very convenient, because you don't have to memorize shortcuts and keybindings for each program separately.

## System configuration as a code

What is very convenient in i3 is the fact, that you can keep and maintain your configuration as a code in the single file located in `~/.config/i3/config`. This file can contain your wallpaper definition, key bindings, configuration for moving and resizing windows, look and feel of the status bar (its colors, location, height, font, etc.) and windows (e.g. I removed title bars, because I don't need them now)

Below, you can see my current i3 config. I keep it up to date in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/pwittchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/i3/config).

I copied colors of the status bar from a place in the web (I don't remember where) and I liked them, so I decided to keep them in my config.

You can see a lot of keywords `$mod` in this config. It's just `Win` key on your keyboard. This config contains a few customizations I made. Probably, I'll describe them in details in separate articles.

One of the useful customizations is key binding for locking the screen. I needed to install additional program called `i3lock` and add the following key binding for it:

```
bindsym $mod+b exec "i3lock -c 17212b"
```

Value in the end of this config is the background color of the locked screen.

## Moving around the system

We don't need to know a lot of keybinding to move aroud the system and use it.

Here are a few default shortcuts I use daily:
- `$mod+Enter` - opens terminal window
- `$mod+arrow` - switches between windows (arrows: left, right, top, bottom)
- `$mod+Shift+arrow` - moves windows (arrows: left, right, top, bottom)
- `$mod+number` - switches between workspaces (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `$mod+Shift+number` - moves window to another workspace (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `$mod+Shit+space` - detaches/attaches window (in case you want to have floating window or you don't want to use it in full screen mode)
- `$mod+Shift+q` - closes window
- `$mod+Shift+e` - opens dialog for closing i3

That's it.

I also use customized/non-default key bindings, which are not default, but they're defined in my config:
- `$mod+b` - locks screen
- `$mod+m` - allows to move floating (detached) window (we need to use shortcut, move window around and then use shortcut again to finish the process)
- `$mod+r` - allows to resize floating (detached) window in the same manner like moving it
- media keys (mute/volume+/volume-/play/pause/next/prev) - they work in the same way like on any other system, but we need to configure this explicitly for i3
- brightness keys (brightness+/-) - same story like media keys

It's powerful thing and we can configure and customize our own key bindings for the stuff we need.

## Status bar configuration as a code

TBD.

## Final thoughts

TBD.
