## Introduction

From a long time I wanted to try lightweight WM (Window Manager) for Linux. I installed i3 once a few years ago, but I had no idea how to use it, so I just closed this thing and got back to Gnome. Recently, I watched several videos and tutorials about Linux and i3 on youtube, which helped me to learn this WM, how it works and how to use it. I also read some part of [docs](https://i3wm.org/docs/) and [user's guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) to customize my configuration. Official docs of i3 are really good.

## Concept

The original concept of i3 and tiling windows managers in general is the fact, that windows are not layered one on top of another like in all typical GUIs for popular operating systems we know today. It makes sense, because when one window is behind another, you cannot see its content anyway. It's possible to do that in i3 by detaching a windows and moving them around, but it's not usual case and default behavior. Today we can see that operating systems like Windows or macOS are trying to mimic behavior of tiling window managers with window splitting, etc. This functionality is available in Unity for Ubuntu and can be achieved with additional plugins for Gnome environment. We also have applications like iTerm for macOS or Tilix for Linux, which mimics the same thing, but just for terminals. In i3, we have this functioality out of the box for *all* programs we use in the system. Not just terminals. We can also use the same key bindings and shortcuts across whole system, which is very convenient, because you don't have to memorize shortcuts and keybindings for each program separately.

## System configuration as a code

What is very convenient in i3 is the fact, that you can keep and maintain your configuration as a code in the single file located in `~/.config/i3/config`. This file can contain your wallpaper definition, key bindings, configuration for moving and resizing windows, look and feel of the status bar (its colors, location, height, font, etc.) and windows (e.g. I removed title bars, because I don't need them now)

Below, you can see my current i3 config. I keep it up to date in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/pwittchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/i3/config).

```
# This file has been auto-generated by i3-config-wizard(1).
# It will not be overwritten, so edit it as you like.
#
# Should you change your keyboard layout some time, delete
# this file and re-run i3-config-wizard(1).

```

I copied colors of the status bar from a place in the web (I don't remember where) and I liked them, so I decided to keep them in my config.

You can see a lot of keywords `$mod` in this config. It's just `Win` key on your keyboard. This config contains a few customizations I made. Probably, I'll describe them in details in separate articles.

One of the useful customizations is key binding for locking the screen. I needed to install additional program called `i3lock` and add the following key binding for it:

```
bindsym $mod+b exec "i3lock -c 17212b"
```

Value in the end of this config is the background color of the locked screen.

## Moving around the system

We don't need to know a lot of keybinding to move aroud the system and use it.

Here are a few default shortcuts I use daily:
- `$mod+Enter` - opens terminal window
- `$mod+d` - opens `dmenu` with available programs (start typing your program name and Hit enter; hit `Esc` to close it)
- `$mod+arrow` - switches between windows (arrows: left, right, top, bottom)
- `$mod+Shift+arrow` - moves windows (arrows: left, right, top, bottom)
- `$mod+number` - switches between workspaces (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `$mod+Shift+number` - moves window to another workspace (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `$mod+Shit+space` - detaches/attaches window (in case you want to have floating window or you don't want to use it in full screen mode)
- `$mod+Shift+q` - closes window
- `$mod+Shift+e` - opens dialog for closing i3

That's it.

I also use customized/non-default key bindings, which are not default, but they're defined in my config:
- `$mod+b` - locks screen
- `$mod+m` - allows to move floating (detached) window (we need to use shortcut, move window around and then use shortcut again to finish the process)
- `$mod+r` - allows to resize floating (detached) window in the same manner like moving it
- media keys (mute/volume+/volume-/play/pause/next/prev) - they work in the same way like on any other system, but we need to configure this explicitly for i3
- brightness keys (brightness+/-) - same story like media keys

It's powerful thing and we can configure and customize our own key bindings for the stuff we need.

## Status bar configuration as a code

Besides system configuration described above, we can keep status bar configuration as a code too! Configuration of the i3bar is well described in the [official documentation](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_configuring_i3bar). As you could see in my `~/.config/i3/config` file above `bar` section looks as follows:

```
bar {
	workspace_buttons yes
    	position top
    	status_command i3status
	font pango:Roboto 10
	height 25
	tray_output none

	colors {
		background #17212b
        	statusline #ffffff
        	separator  #666666
        	active_workspace   #2c3e50 #2c3e50 #1abc9c
        	focused_workspace  #2c3e50 #2c3e50 #1abc9c
        	inactive_workspace #2c3e50 #2c3e50 #ecf0f1
        	urgent_workspace   #e74c3c #e74c3c #ecf0f1
    	}
}
```

Command called `status_command` invokes `i3status` program, which is default setup, but there are at least a few programs, which can be used instead of this to customize and enhance status bar. For now, I decided to use default option because it's good enough for me. You can also see that I customized colors, font, height, removed tray icons and moved status bar to the top (default position is bottom).

When we are using `i3status`, then detailed configuration of status bar is located in `~/.config/i3status/config` file. You can check my current config below and in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/pwittchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/i3status/config)

```

}
```

We can setup refresh interval of our status bar, which is 10 s in my case, but we can increase or decrease it if we want.

As you can see, I configured multiple things. Going from the left:
- network connectivity (WiFi + strength or wired connection + IP address)
- usage of battery 0
- usage of battery 1 (I have 2 batteries in my Thinkpad)
- free space on the root directory
- free space in the home directory
- load (number of processes waiting to be executed)
- usage of CPU
- usage of RAM
- sound
- currently played Spotify song
- screen brightness
- number of new pacman packages to be updated
- number of new RSS news from newsboat
- air quality in my city monitored via Airly
- weather in my city
- date, time and time zone

To make it all work, I needed to write a few additional scripts in Python and Bash, create log files to be read in the status bar, configure dunst notifications to monitor changing Spotify songs, etc. Maybe I'll put details of these configs in the separate articles.

## Notifications

By default i3 doesn't have any notifications. If we want to have them, we need to install notification daemon. We have a few choices. I decided to go with [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/), which is nice and minimalistic notification daemon. It's also configurable and we can put its configuration into `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` file. You can check my configuration for this daemon in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/pwittchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc) as well as previous configs. I've done a few adjustments in this file to make notifications be consistent with colors of the system and my personal preferences. I also moved notification window a little bit down because it was covering status bar. You can test notification with `notify-send` command. Remember to kill `dunst` after applying changes in the config to see them. Moreover, after installing `dunst`, we need to start it to invoke the daemon and then after future system start-ups it will start automatically.

## Working with multiple screens

In my current setup, I have laptop screen and external monitor. By default, i3 utilizes all available screens and first workspace is located in my primary (laptop) monitor. When I would like to use this workspace on my external screen, when laptop lid is closed, then I need to disable laptop screen. It's not neccessary, when you are using both laptop and external monitor. To do that, I'm using [xrandr](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr) program. I created wrapper for this program called `monitor.sh`, which you can find in `.scripts` directory in my dotfiles repository.

Key functionalities of this script looks as follows:

```bash
function list {
  xrandr --listmonitors
}

function laptopoff {
  xrandr --output eDP-1 --off
}

function laptopmirror {
  xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --output HDMI-2 --mode 1920x1080 --same-as eDP-1
}

function reset {
  xrandr --auto
}

function wallreload {
  feh --bg-scale ~/Pictures/wallpapers/mountains/aerial-photography-of-snowy-field-viewing-mountain.jpg
}
```

When I start the system, log in and close the laptop lid, I need to execute `monitor.sh laptopoff` to disable laptop screen, and then `monitor.sh wallreload` to reload wallpaper and adjust it into the higher resolution for the workspace 1. `eDP-` is name of my laptop monitor and it may be different in your case. In order, to reset settings, I can use `reset` command. It's more convenient than remembering all `xrandr` commands.

## WiFi and Bluetooth

### WiFi

i3 doesn't have any control panel window known from desktop environments like Gnome. If we want to use WiFi and Bluetooth, we need command line tools (or GUI if we prefer) installed additionally in the system. For WiFi, I'm using [nmcli](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Usage). To list WiFi networks, we can type:

```
nmcli dev wifi
```

To connect to the given network, we can type:


```
nmcli --ask device wifi connect hot_spot_name
```

I also created wrapper for this, which you can find in `network.sh` file inside `.scripts` directory in my dotfiles repository.

### Bluetooth

We have the same story with Bluetooth. In order to connect to bluetooth devices, I'm using `bluetoothctl` program.

To display devices, we can type:

```
bluetoothctl devices
```

In order to connect to the device, we can type:


```
bluetoothctl connect mac_address
```

I also created wrapper for this stuff, which allows me to connect to different devices, enable/disable bluetooth, start scanning, show paired devices, etc. You can find it in `bluetooth.sh` in my dotfiles repository in the same place where previous scripts are located.

## Final thoughts

i3 WM is definitely great Window Manager. Probably the best I have been using so far. Initial configuration and setup can be overwhelming, but once we can into it, it will become clear and simple. Whole system is very fast, highly configurable, we can store complete configuration in the files and easily reproduce it on other machines or in our own machine in case when something will go wrong or we just want to reinstall the system. Using shortcuts and tiling windows all the time may be odd in the beginning, but once we get used into it, usage of this system is very efficient and conveninent. I have been using MS Windows, macOS, Unity desktop environment and Gnome in the past. i3wm is my favorite environment so far. Once we perform all the configuration in the beginning, we don't have to touch it later until we want to change or add something. I wouldn't recommend this WM to someone who doesn't like computers, configurations, solving problems, etc. If you want something working out of the box, which you can trade for speed, high customization, control over your system, etc., then you should choose macOS, Windows or maybe Gnome if you prefer Linux.
